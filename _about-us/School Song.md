The boys and girls of Rosyth School <br> 
We march in thousands strong <br> 
We love our work, we love our play <br> 
We all know right from wrong <br>
The will to serve our Singapore <br>
Grows stronger day by day <br>
We take a stand the growing band <br>
And fight the glorious way <br>

#### **Chorus**

For Rosyth School, our Rosyth School <br>
To serve we will endeavour <br>
A leading light and shining bright <br>
Rosyth School forever

In times of stress and strain we find <br>
The joy of strong endeavour <br>
In spite of setbacks in our work <br>
We strive along together <br> 
Our teamwork is a source of strength <br> 
And ruggedness another <br>
To meet the challenge of the day <br>
For Rosyth School forever

#### **(Chorus)**
