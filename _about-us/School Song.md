The boys and girls of Rosyth School
We march in thousands strong
We love our work, we love our play
We all know right from wrong
The will to serve our Singapore
Grows stronger day by day
We take a stand the growing band
And fight the glorious way

**Chorus**

For Rosyth School, our Rosyth School
To serve we will endeavour 
A leading light and shining bright
Rosyth School forever

In times of stress and strain we find
The joy of strong endeavour 
In spite of setbacks in our work
We strive along together
Our teamwork is a source of strength
And ruggedness another
To meet the challenge of the day
For Rosyth School forever

**(Chorus)**
