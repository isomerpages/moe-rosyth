This Award is awarded by the Ministry of Education (Singapore).

The School Distinction Award was first introduced in 2004 to give recognition to schools with well-integrated and sustainable school processes and practices that have provided useful educational and developmental outcomes for the students.  

To get the top award, a school must shine in three different areas - such as uniformed groups, the arts and sports - and win two Best Practice Awards, including one for all-round student development.
