This Award is awarded by Spring Singapore.

The Singapore Quality Class and Singapore Quality Award are key milestones of the overall business excellence standard. The business excellence initiative helps organisations to know where they are on the excellence journey and what they need to do to achieve a higher level of performance. This is done through an assessment of an organisationâ€™s performance against the requirements of an internationally benchmarked business excellence framework. It also recognises organisations for their performance on the business excellence journey.
