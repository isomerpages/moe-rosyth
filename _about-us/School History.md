### SCHOOL HISTORY

Rosyth School started in 1956. It was situated at Rosyth Road from which it derived its name. The majority of pupils then were from the neighbouring kampungs. In early 1983, the school was identified as one of the four primary schools to host the Gifted Education Programme.

At the end of that year, the school moved to Parry Avenue.

The school had seven Principals. <br>
1) Mr Chee Seng Kee (1956 - 1959) <br>
2) Mrs Bertha Neo (1959 - 1978), <br>
3) Miss Ada Ponnappa (1978 - 1990) <br>
4) Mr Foo Chee Meng (1990 - 1997) <br>
5) Mr Fong Whay Chong (1997 - 2000) <br>
6) Miss Elizabeth Chan Boey Koon (2001 - 2005) <br>
7) Mrs Celine Ng (2005 - 2015) 

With effect from 15 December 2015, Mdm Elis Tan took over principalship.

In 2001, the school was relocated to Serangoon North Ave 4 to accomodate the increasing student population. There are currently almost 2030 students.

***By Mr Loh Khee Yew (Creator of the School Crest)***

The original version of the badge was an etched metal, measuring W2cm xL2.5cm x D1mm. The elements comprise a candle, stripes, white and blue colours and the school motto ‘Ready to Serve’. When I was asked to design the Rosyth school badge, the first icon that came into my mind was the candle. Chinese scholars and clergymen of medieval times depended on the candlelight for the long hours of learned reading and writing, as electricity was not invented then. 

Knowledge has long been documented in the form of pictograms, symbols and written words. Whilst the mode of reading may differ from one ethnic culture to another, The horizontal line formation has been the general accepted norm. The stripes represent the written page. The shield format is associated with one arming himself/herself with knowledge.

The motto aims to inculcate amongst the students a sense of civic consciousness and be ‘Ready to Serve’ the country, community and family whom he/she belongs.

(Loh Khee Yew was a pioneer staff member 1956 – 1963)

### SCHOOL SONG

The boys and girls of Rosyth School <br> 
We march in thousands strong <br> 
We love our work, we love our play <br> 
We all know right from wrong <br>

Grows stronger day by day <br>
We take a stand the growing band <br>
And fight the glorious way <br>

We strive along together <br> 
Our teamwork is a source of strength <br> 
And ruggedness another <br>
To meet the challenge of the day <br>
For Rosyth School forever
