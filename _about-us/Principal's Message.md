Education is one of the most precious gifts that we can give any child.&nbsp; A good education should inspire belief in the students and influence them to lead meaningful and purposeful lives. The focus of education is not only the pursuit of academic excellence but more importantly to develop students of character anchored in positive and enduring values. In Rosyth School, we encapsulate the values of **I**ntegrity, **C**are &amp; **E**mpathy, Gr**A**titude, **R**espect &amp; Resilience and Innovativ**E** Spirit as **I-CARE**.

The school's programmes and activities are geared towards ensuring that students are developed holistically and equipped with the knowledge, skills, values and dispositions that are essential in the 21st Century. Our students get many opportunities to discover their talents and passions, and to excel in their pursuits. They are called to **Learn with Passion, Serve with Compassion and Lead with Vision**. With these, we aspire for our Rosythians to be always ready to serve in small or big ways to make a positive difference to those around them.

The staff in Rosyth aim to provide all our students with a vibrant learning environment by leveraging engaging learning spaces and innovative teaching pedagogies.&nbsp; We want the school to be a place that stimulates and nurtures the studentsâ€™ imagination and intellectual curiosity.&nbsp;The school also believes that providing a good education involves working closely with all our stakeholders, especially parents, and building strong supportive partnerships.

I hope our school website gives you an insight into life of our close-knit Rosythian family and provides you with the information you seek. I welcome your suggestions to further improve the content by providing your feedback via rosyth_sch@schools.gov.sg
