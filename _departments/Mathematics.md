### VISION

***Innovative Problem-solvers, Creative Thinkers*** 

### MISSION

***Developing lifelong learning with a passion for Mathematics.***

##### DESIRED OUTCOMES

In Rosyth School, we aim to nurture Rosythians who are able to think logically, abstractly, critically, creatively and innovatively.

Through Rosyth Signature Programmes and Rosyth Learning Experiences, we develop Rosythians’ metacognition, as well as their appreciation for the beauty and depth of Mathematics. Rosythians are also given opportunities and platforms to extend and apply their learning of Mathematics.

**Rosyth Signature Programmes:**

* STAR approach to problem-solving
* Rosyth Learning Experiences <br>
         - Differentiated Instructions <br>
				 - Learning Centres <br>
				 - Formative Assessment <br>
				 - Open-ended Tasks <br>
				 - Gamification <br>
* Student Leaders in Mathematics

##### SIGNATURE PROGRAMMES

**STAR approach to problem-solving (P1 – P6)**

In Rosyth School, we have a structured approach for teaching heuristics and problem- solving skills.  STAR is the acronym for this structured approach.

* S – Study the Problem
* T – Think of a plan
* A – Act on the plan
* R – Reflect on your own answer

**Rosythians’ Learning Experiences**

Differentiated Instructions (DI): <br>
All students have the same learning goal. In Rosyth School, our teachers have developed a series of DI lessons to meet the diverse learning needs of our students in order to maximise their progress in learning; these lessons vary based on students' interests, preferences, strengths, and struggles.

Learning Centres (P1 and P2): <br>
Learning Centre is a method of instruction in which small groups of students move through many learning centers, or stations, allowing teachers to differentiate instruction by incorporating students' needs, interests, and learning styles. This involves group work whereby our students have the opportunities to apply their learning and demonstrate their thinking skills aloud to their peers.

Formative Assessment: <br>
The Mathematics department makes use of Formative Assessment (FA) to discover what our students know while they’re still in the process of learning it.

FA is a planned, ongoing process used by all students and teachers during learning and teaching to elicit and use evidence of student learning to improve student understanding of intended disciplinary learning outcomes and support students to become self-directed learners.

Teachers make use of tools like the Mini Whiteboard. The mini whiteboard allows teachers to assess students on their knowledge of the topics and their ability to perform procedural skills in mathematics. The feedback gained would be used by teachers to determine if the class is ready to move on to more challenging tasks.

One of the main strategies used in FA is “**Find the errors and fix them**”.

Our students are provided with solutions, both right and wrong to evaluate.  They would comment on the mistakes made, the organization of the solutions and misconception. This allows our students to be more reflective learners and understand the concepts taught better.

“**If you learned it, help someone who hasn’t**” is another strategy that teachers use to guide their students to be self-directed learners.

Students are encouraged to share their learning with their friends and point out key words/  phrases which help them to identify the concepts and methods to use in problem solving. Through teaching and learning from their peers, our students are able to understand the concepts and strategies better.

Open-ended Tasks: <br>
Learning Mathematics with open-ended tasks is an important experience that our students undergo in Rosyth School. Such tasks are open, i.e. there is no one fixed answer (many possible answers).  They can be solved in different ways and on different levels (accessible to mixed abilities).  These open-ended tasks empower our Rosythians to make their own mathematical decisions and make room for their own mathematical thinking. These enable them to further develop reasoning and communication skills, which is an important competency in the 21st century. For example, the Primary 4 students have to take on the role of an Urban Planner, plan its land usage for a particular plot of land, and come up with all the possible dimensions of the rectangular plot of land and calculate the cost of fencing, based on the type of fencing!

Gamification: <br>
Motivation is one of the core benefits of game-based learning. It tends to be increased, as games are naturally thrilling and successful in keeping the players hooked. Our Math department uses a lot of gamification to get our students to arrive at that “high joy, high learning” state, so that they are engaged and be able to apply what they have learnt.

One example of such a learning experience is when the department created a Halloween-themed Escape Room (Imagine dimmed room, light stick, spooky music, scary decorations and actors who ‘scare’ the students!) for our Math learners to work as a team and solve challenging Math questions on Volume, Geometry and Fractions!

**Student Leaders in Mathematics**
The Mathematics Student Representatives of Rosyth School are chosen to serve a pivotal role in the classroom ecosystem of care and leadership. They serve two main groups of people – their Mathematics teachers and their classmates. They are to lead with passion in their classrooms by being innovative problem-solvers and creative thinkers in learning Mathematics, and be role-models of lifelong learners with a passion for Mathematics. For example, they do research on famous Mathematicians and the positive traits that they have, and how they contribute to the world with their findings.  Together with their teachers, the Mathematics representatives in the class help to shape the dynamics of the class towards a positive and caring climate in the learning of Mathematics.

##### Rosyth Learning Support Programme for Mathematics

The programme provides early intervention so that pupils will have a good foundation in Mathematics. The focus is on equipping pupils with basic mathematical skills and concepts. It aims to build pupils’ confidence and positive beliefs about their ability to do Mathematics. The programme supports Primary 1 to Primary 3 pupils.

**Important features in the Learning Support Programme for Mathematics**

* Small group teaching so pupils receive more attention
* Parallel teaching but at a slower pace
* Pupils learn through hands-on-experiences
