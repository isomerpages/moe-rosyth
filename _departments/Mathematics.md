##### SIGNATURE PROGRAMMES

STAR approach to problem-solving (P1 – P6)

* S – Study the Problem
* T – Think of a plan
* A – Act on the plan
* R – Reflect on your own answer

Rosyth Thinking Programme
In this Rosyth Thinking Programme (RTP), P3 students are challenged with Thinking Tasks that are set in interesting and authentic contexts, and constructed with an open question or a twist. These tasks are content-based, and are usually open and multi-dimensional. Thus, they arouse students’ curiosity and naturally lead them to search for solutions. As they search for out-of-the-box answers, they will need to think critically and creatively about the problems and their possible solutions. They use skills such as making conjectures, analysing, synthesising, and evaluating information gathered from observations, experiences, reasoning and communication.

The school integrates a differentiated **‘Challenge-Enrich-Support’** approach into its tasks and activities. Higher-ability students are challenged their thinking, while support structures are in place to encourage the less able.

##### PROBLEM SOLVING

Mathematical problem solving is central to mathematics learning. It involves the acquisition and application of mathematics concepts and skills in a wide range of situations, including non-routine, open-ended and real-world problems.

One of the aims of mathematics education is to develop the mathematical thinking and problem solving skills and apply these skills to formulate and solve problems.

Problem solving can be made easier when children are mentally equipped with a ready set of thinking skills and heuristics.

The essential thinking skills are:
* Classifying – arranging pieces of information into meaningful groups
* Comparing – making comparisons among groups or pieces of information
* Sequencing – arranging information into a meaningful/logical order
* Analysing parts and wholes – comparing, visualizing and synthesizing various bits of information and making sense of them as a whole
* Identifying patterns and relationships
* Induction – making generalizations using specific examples
* Deduction – infer various specific examples from given generalizations
* Spatial visualization – mentally manipulate (“logical imagination”) an object/a problem without concrete materials
* The heuristics are the tools which children use based on the plan that they have created from their thinking skills.
* Listed below are the heuristics, categorized into 4 groups, that children can employ in helping them solve problems.

* To give a representation – e.g. draw a diagram, make a list, use equations
* To make a calculated guess – e.g. guess and check, look for patterns, make suppositions
* To go through the process – e.g. act it out, work backwards, before & after concept
* To change the problem – e.g. restate the problem, simplify the problem, solve part of the problem

**Steps for problem-solving**

Knowing how to solve problems is an important skill and an essential part of our lives. George Polya, a mathematician, spent considerable effort on trying to characterize the methods that people use to solve problems, and to describe how problem-solving should be taught and learned.

Polya devised a general approach that one can take to solve a problem.

**4 Steps for Problem-Solving**

*Step 1: UNDERSTAND the problem*

* Read the problem carefully to understand what is required in the problem.
* Break up the problem into smaller sections and understand each section thoroughly before moving on to understand the next section.
* Draw or write down the information given in the problem in a simpler form to help you understand better.

*Step 2: PLAN what to do/Devise a plan*

* Choose a heuristic to use to solve the problem

*Step 3: DO it/Carry out the plan*

* Use computational skills, geometrical skills and logical reasoning to carry out your plan to solve the problem.

*Step 4: CHECK the solution/Review*

* Check the reasonableness of your solution
* Improve on the method used
* Seek alternative solutions
* Extend the method to other problems

*In short, the 4-steps for problem-solving is*

* Understand
* Plan
* Do
* Check
