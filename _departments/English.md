<h3>VISION</h3>
<p><strong><em>Our Pupils will be Effective and Confident Communicators</em></strong>
</p>
<h3>MISSION</h3>
<p>To instill the love for English Language learning and to cultivate a rich
environment for development of reading, writing, listening and speaking
skills.</p>
<h3>DESIRED OUTCOMES</h3>
<p>All pupils should attain foundational skills, particularly in grammar,
spelling and basic pronunciation. The majority of our pupils will attain
a good level of competence in English, in both speech and writing.</p>
<h3>KEY PROGRAMMES</h3>
<h5>CORE CURRICULUM <br></h5>
<p><strong>STELLAR @ Rosyth (STrategies for English Language Learning And Reading )</strong>
</p>
<p>The core curriculum seeks to develop our pupils holistically, with a comprehensive,
stimulating and engaging instructional programme.</p>
<p><strong>The objectives of the programme are as follows:</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>To employ a variety of effective teaching and learning pedagogies that
focus on WHAT and HOW pupils are learning;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To have a balanced and holistic assessment of our pupils.</p>
<p></p>

<h5>SIGNATURE PROGRAMMES</h5>
<p><strong>ERP @ Rosyth ( Extensive Reading Programme)</strong> 
</p>
<p>As part of our ERP@Rosyth, one English period a week is ringfenced in
the timetable to provide dedicated time for leisure reading in all Primary
1 to Primary 6 classes. Through this programme, pupils are exposed to a
plethora of reading materials and genres. Lower Primary pupils are also
given opportunities to visit the library on a regular basis as well as
participate in a carefully curated set of activities to encourage them
to cultivate good reading habits from young. Library activities are compiled
into a teacher-designed booklet and differentiated to arouse interest.
The different activities give the pupils autonomy when they explore texts
of different genres and plan their completion on their own, thus developing
self-directedness in learning.</p>
<p>Through our programme, we hope to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Inculcate a love for reading amongst our pupils;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop competency and independence in reading; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enable pupils to analyse local issues critically and be engaged in discussions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Reading Circles</strong> 
</p>
<p>Literature is incorporated into our curriculum for selected pupils. Through
this programme, we hope to provide opportunities for advanced readers to
develop greater appreciation of the various literary elements in stories
and deepen comprehension skills based on prescribed texts.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Read@Rosyth</strong> 
</p>
<p>To promote the use of good English in Speaking, Reading, Writing and Listening,
a host of engaging activities are planned to arouse pupils’ interest in
the speaking of the language. Examples of some of these activities include
NLB Bulk Borrowing (Read, Swap, Share), “It’s Storytime!” book sharing
and “Book Character Day” as part of our READ@Rosyth programme.</p>
<p>Pupils are provided with opportunities to perform to their classmates,
pupils in other classes as well as the general school population. This
is in alignment with the desired outcomes to nurtrure each child into a
confident person, self-directed learner, active contributor and concerned
citizen.</p>
<p>Through the various school programmes, we hope that Rosythians will be
able to use English to communicate well with each other and build happy
relationships. Teachers and parents are especially important in this initiative
as we are the main facilitators who play a very important role in the acquisition
and usage of Standard English.</p>

<p><strong>Primary 1 Moo-O PiSP (Parents-in-School Programme)</strong>
</p>
<p>The Moo-O programme has been incorporated into the P1-2 English curriculum
in Rosyth. It uses a reading software that transforms the way stories are
read and enjoyed, by involving the readers in the virtual story world as
story characters. It is designed to help children read well, by letting
them experience and understand how by reading fluently and expressively,
they can enjoy their stories better. The programme strives to develop oracy
and collaborative learning amongst our pupils.</p>
<p>The programme has provided the school with the opportunity to build successful
partnerships with our parents through the implementation of the Primary
1 Moo-O PiSP (Parents-in-School Programme) during Curriculum Time. This
programme aims to enhance the level of parental involvement in the school
curriculum and hence, foster greater partnership with parents in the child’s
learning.</p>
<p></p>
<h5>SUPPORT PROGRAMMES<br></h5>
<p><strong>Learning Support Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>The Learning Support Programme (LSP) is an early intervention programme
aimed at providing additional support to pupils who enter Primary 1 with
weak English language and literacy skills. Its objective is to equip the
pupils with basic reading and spelling skills.</p>
<p>To further support and enable pupils to be able to transit into the primary
school curriculum, R.E.A.P. (Reading Extensively Afterschool Programme)
caters to selected pupils who need additional scaffolding with specific
focus on reading and wordsight. This programme is conducted by teachers
who are trained to aid pupils in bridging their learning at entry levels.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>PREP with MUMs @ Rosyth</strong>
<br>PREP with MUMs @ Rosyth is a programme that aims to equip weak readers
with the reading skills necessary for their daily school work. The programme
also aims to help pupils cultivate good reading habits and ignite their
love for reading so that in time to come, these pupils will become successful
readers who will no longer learn to read but rather, they will read at
more appropriately challenging levels in order to read to learn.</p>
<p>The programme provides opportunities for pupils to be exposed to word
games, pupil collaboration and class presentations. There are also opportunities
for independent learning through book reviews. The programme strives to
foster deep learning to enhance greater pupil motivation.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Reading Remediation Programme (RRP) &amp; School Dyslexia Remediation Programme (SDR)</strong>
</p>
<p>These two intervention programmes cater to pupils who have been assessed
to require further support at the mid levels. Teacher instructors are specially
trained to conduct targeted and focused lessons to equip pupils with the
necessary skills pertaining to phonemic awareness and reading comprehension.</p>
