### VISION
***Confident Learners, Active Inquirers***

### MISSION
* Having a strong focus on process and thinking skills.
* Stimulating curiosity and inculcating responsibility to the environment.

### 3 PILLARS OF THE SCIENCE DEPARTMENT



##### Core Pillar: Science Curriculum

The Primary Science Syllabus aims to provide students with experiences/ opportunities to: 
* Build on their interest and stimulate their curiosity about themselves and their environment.
* Acquire basic scientific concepts to help them understand themselves and the world around them. 
* Develop skills, dispositions, and attitudes for scientific inquiry. 
* Apply scientific concepts and skills in making responsible decisions.
* Appreciate how Science influences people and the environment.

##### Sustainability Pillar:  Environmental Education

**Overarching Goal:** LIVE GREEN

**Objective:** To sustain the earth for us, others, and the generations to come through reducing carbon footprint in school, home and society 

**Approach:** Through the Three E’s (Education, Exposure and Experience)

**Areas of Focus:** 
* Food: Urban Farming – to grow your own plants for food to achieve 30% of local food produce as part of food security; how to select food from sustainable sources. 
* Materials: 4Rs (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle and Repurpose), using recyclable bags, bring your own containers, reduce food waste.
* Energy: ways to reduce energy waste and maximise solar energy

##### Innovation Pillar: Applied Learning Programme (STEM Education)

To provide students with the learning experience which can build three innovative mind shifts:
* Be Curious – What is the problem?
* Be Creative – There must be a better way.
* Be the Change – Lead and Inspire others

##### 4 BELIEFS OF THE SCIENCE DEPARTMENT

***1. Student – Centricity:*** <br> 
We have adopted the 3 “IN”s Approach to encapsulates the overall experience of our students in Science education: Inspire Inquire and Innovate

* (a) INspired by Science. Students enjoy learning Science and are fascinated by how everyday phenomena have scientific connections and how Science helps solve many of our global challenges. They regard Science as relevant and meaningful, appreciating how Science and Technology have transformed the world, and improved our lives. Students are open to the possibility of pursuing Science-related careers as a viable profession to serve the good of society. 
* INquire like Scientists. Students have strong fundamentals in Science and possess the spirit of scientific inquiry. They are able to engage confidently in the Practices of Science, grounded in the knowledge, issues and questions that relate to the roles played by Science in daily life, society and the environment. They can discern, weigh alternatives, and evaluate claims and ideas critically, based on logical scientific evidence and arguments, and yet be able to suspend judgement where there is lack of evidence. 
* INnovate using Science. Students apply Science to generate creative solutions to solve real-world problems, ranging from those affecting everyday lives to complex problems affecting humanity. It is envisaged that there will be a strong pipeline of students who can contribute towards STEM research, innovation, and enterprise.



***2. Helping Every Child learn Science:*** <br> 
We have differentiated approach for each topic **(Challenge-Enrich –Support)** and we have produced our own activity books to tailor to the needs of our students.

In addition we have differentiated programmes to challenge, enrich and support our students in science learning.

| Challenge | Enrich | Support |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| E2K Programme <br> Tan Kah Kee Young Inventor’s Award | STEM Applied Learning Programme (ALP) <br> Sony Creative Toy Challenge <br> VIA in Science <br> Amazing Science <br> Learning Journeys | Pull-out Programme |

***3. Holistic Education*** <br> 
We collaborate with different departments to design interdisciplinary projects that integrate knowledge and skills from various subjects. This approach helps students see the interconnectedness of different fields and fosters a holistic understanding of complex topics.

***4. Instill values through Science*** <br>
We have garnered partnerships with other organizations to help students appreciate how science influences people and the environment.
