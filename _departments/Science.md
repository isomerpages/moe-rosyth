<h5>1.1 Core Pillar: Science Curriculum</h5>
<p>1. Student – centricity:</p>
<p>We have adopted the 3 “IN”s approach to encapsulate the overall experience
of our students in Science education: Inspire Inquire and Innovate</p>
<p>• INquire like Scientists: Students possess strong Science fundamentals,
engage in scientific practices, and critically evaluate claims based on
evidence, while remaining open to suspending judgment when evidence is
insufficient.</p>
<p>• INspired by Science: Students enjoy learning Science, fascinated by
its connection to everyday phenomena and global challenges. They value
its relevance, recognizing how Science and Technology improve lives, and
are open to pursuing Science-related careers for societal benefit.</p>
<p>• INnovate using Science. Students apply Science to solve real-world problems,
fostering innovation. This creates a strong pipeline of individuals contributing
to STEM research, innovation, and enterprise.</p>
<p>2. Helping every child learn Science:</p>
<p>We have differentiated approach for each topic (Challenge-Enrich –Support).</p>

<p>3. Holistic education</p>
<p>We collaborate with different departments to design interdisciplinary
projects that integrate knowledge and skills from various subjects. This
approach helps students see the interconnectedness of different fields
and fosters a holistic understanding of complex topics.</p>

<h5>1.2 Sustainability Pillar: Environmental Education</h5>
<p>At Rosyth, we strive to sustain the Earth for current and future generations
by reducing our carbon footprint across school, home, and society. We hope
to achieve this through the Three E’s: Education, Exposure, and Experience,
to foster awareness, inspire action, and effect lasting changes.</p>
<p>Areas of Focus:</p>
<p>• Food: Urban Farming – to grow your own plants for food to achieve 30%
of local food produce as part of food security; how to select food from
sustainable sources.</p>
<p>• Materials: 4Rs (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle and Repurpose), using recyclable
bags, bring your own containers, reduce food waste.</p>
<p>• Energy: Ways to reduce energy waste and maximise solar energy</p>

<h5>1.3 Innovation Pillar: Applied Learning Programme (STEM Education)</h5>
<p>Rosythians are provided with transformative learning experiences to foster
three key innovative mind shifts: curiosity-driven exploration, critical
thinking and problem-solving, to develop a deep appreciation for the role
of Science in shaping the future of society and the environment.</p>
<p>Our innovation spirit:</p>
<p>• Be Curious – What is the problem?</p>
<p>• Be Creative – There must be a better way.</p>
<p>• Be the Change – Lead and inspire others!</p>
