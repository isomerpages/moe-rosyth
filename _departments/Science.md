##### 5 BELIEFS OF THE SCIENCE DEPARTMENT

***1. Student – Centricity:*** <br> 
We have adopted the 5-E Inquiry Approach to able our students to acquire knowledge and understanding of their natural and physical world based on investigations, apply the skills and processes of inquiry and develop attitudes and values that are essential to the practice of science.

| | | 
| -------- | -------- | 
| **Engage** | Object, event or question used to engage students. <br> Connections facilitated between what students know and can do. |
| **Explore** | Objects and phenomena are explored. <br> Hands-on activities, with guidance. |
| **Explain** | Students explain their understanding concepts & processes. New concepts and skills are introduced as conceptual clarity and cohesion are sought. |
| **Elaborate** | Activities allow students to apply concepts in contexts, and build on or extend understanding and skill. |
| **Evalute** | Students assess their knowledge, skills and abilities. <br> Activities permit evaluation of student development & lesson effectiveness. |

***2. Helping Every Child learn Science:*** <Br> 
We have differentiated approach for each topic **(Challenge-Enrich –Support)** and we have produced our own activity books to tailor to the needs of our students.

In addition we have differentiated programmes to challenge, enrich and support our students in science learning.

| E2 K Programme<br>Destination Imgination<br>Applied Learning Programme<br>Sony Toy Challenge | Life Sciences<br>Green Programmes<br>VIA in Science<br>Compositing Project<br> Amazing Science<br> Amazing Science | Pull-out Programme |

***3. Age–appropriateness:*** <br> 
We have adopted spiral approach to teach the Science Process Skills. We have produced our own workbook to teach the process skills in increasing level of difficulty to lead to imminent learning.

***4. Holistic Education*** <br> 
We collaborate with other departments in the school to enrich students' learning

***5. Instill values through Science*** <br>
We have garnered partnerships with other organizations to help students appreciate how science influences people and the environment

| External Organization | Programmes |
|---|---|
| PUB | P5 NEWater Visitors' Centre - Raingarden Worskshop<br>Adoption of Waterway at Bishan-AMK Park |
| RWS | P6 LJ to LKCNHM on animal adaptations |
| NEA | P3 Buddy Clean<br>Youth for the Environment Day (YED) - Whole school |
| NParks | P4 Biodiversity & VIA in Bishan-AMK Park<br>P3 Every Child a Seed Programme |

**Safety in the Science Laboratory**
* Has a safety workplan.
* Customised safety guidelines for Special rooms.
* Safety briefing conducted at the beginning of the academic year in all special rooms
* Safety posters were prominently displayed
* Rams are done for science experiments involving heat and chemicals and outdoor learning
