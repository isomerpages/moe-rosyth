<h5>4 BELIEFS OF THE SCIENCE DEPARTMENT</h5>
<p><strong><em>1. Student – Centricity:</em></strong> 
<br>We have adopted the 3 “IN”s Approach to encapsulates the overall experience
of our students in Science education: Inspire Inquire and Innovate</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>INspired by Science. Students enjoy learning Science and are fascinated
by how everyday phenomena have scientific connections and how Science helps
solve many of our global challenges. They regard Science as relevant and
meaningful, appreciating how Science and Technology have transformed the
world, and improved our lives. Students are open to the possibility of
pursuing Science-related careers as a viable profession to serve the good
of society.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>INquire like Scientists. Students have strong fundamentals in Science
and possess the spirit of scientific inquiry. They are able to engage confidently
in the Practices of Science, grounded in the knowledge, issues and questions
that relate to the roles played by Science in daily life, society and the
environment. They can discern, weigh alternatives, and evaluate claims
and ideas critically, based on logical scientific evidence and arguments,
and yet be able to suspend judgement where there is lack of evidence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>INnovate using Science. Students apply Science to generate creative solutions
to solve real-world problems, ranging from those affecting everyday lives
to complex problems affecting humanity. It is envisaged that there will
be a strong pipeline of students who can contribute towards STEM research,
innovation, and enterprise.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>2. Helping Every Child learn Science:</em></strong> 
<br>We have differentiated approach for each topic <strong>(Challenge-Enrich –Support)</strong> and
we have produced our own activity books to tailor to the needs of our students.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/differentiation.png">
</div>
<p>In addition we have differentiated programmes to challenge, enrich and
support our students in science learning.</p>

<p><strong><em>3. Holistic Education</em></strong> 
<br>We collaborate with different departments to design interdisciplinary
projects that integrate knowledge and skills from various subjects. This
approach helps students see the interconnectedness of different fields
and fosters a holistic understanding of complex topics.</p>
<p><strong><em>4. Instill values through Science</em></strong> 
<br>We have garnered partnerships with other organizations to help students
appreciate how science influences people and the environment</p>
