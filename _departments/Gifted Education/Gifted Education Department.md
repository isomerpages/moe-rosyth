### VISION

***A Love For Learning and Learning to Love***

##### DESIRED OUTCOMES <br> 

**Socially adaptable**

Students are engaged individually and in small groups, or as a class, challenged by knowledge, concepts and skills in the various disciplines, as well as through interdisciplinary approaches. Students learn in a community, in an extended family called the Rosythian family. They learn to accept themselves, and others in class, and learn to work and live harmoniously with others in the school. They are also exposed to other communities outside the school in the hope that they would learn to sympathise or even empathise with others.

**Growth Mindset**

Every child is different. He has strengths or talents. He is helped and guided, and recognised and acknowledged as an individual. The challenge is in creating a greater love and thirst for knowledge and skills and this motivation will help each one succeed in life.


##### KEY PROGRAMMES OF GEP <br> 

**VALUES-IN-ACTION (VIA)** <br>

Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) in the GEP is the formal instructional curriculum developed for the teaching of desired values and life-skills essential to nurturing pupils, guiding them on their journey towards realising their potential.  The strategies and activities used in teaching CCE aim to help pupils affirm their gifts, equip them with self-awareness and self-management skills to achieve personal and social well-being.

In Rosyth School, the Values-In-Action programme is undergirded by our beliefs:

I can make a difference through:
* T ouching livee
* O bserving and
* U nderstanding the community
* C herishing people and
* H elping others

Pupils undertake Values-In-Action (VIA) projects to identify real community needs.  Through these projects, the pupils learn with passion, serve with compassion and lead with vision.

**COMPUTER ENRICHMENT PROGRAMME (CEP)**

Students will be enrolled in the Computer Enrichment Program which take place on selected days after school-hours. Students will taught how to understand and apply digital technologies and in the process, acquire media literacy.

Besides that, students will also be taught safe and responsible use of computers and the internet in our Cyberwellness programmes. Students who are keen may also sign up for the Cyberwellness Student Ambassador Programme and serve the school community as Cyberwellness Ambassadors. They will plan and arrange activities to share and promote Cyberwellness values in school.
