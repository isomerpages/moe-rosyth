***Affective Education and Community Involvement Programme***

GEP students are provided with a comprehensive Affective Education programme to prepare them for their transition to the GEP and to equip them with soft skills and life skills such as Habits of the Mind, organizational and communication skills, group dynamics, decision making and leadership skills. Students have regular meetings with their teachers in their pastoral care groups to talk about issues and discuss concerns they may have.

Students undertake Community Involvement Projects to contribute their services to the school and the community. Through these projects, the students learn to work in groups and brainstorm ideas to help others. For example, the Primary 4 students set up game stalls for the lower primary students to teach them language and mathematical skills. The Primary 5 plan and execute a Service Learning Project and gave tuition to a group of Primary 3 students who were weak in Mathematics. The Primary 6 students partnered with MINDS (Movement for the Intellectually Disabled of Singapore) to help them raise funds through the selling of merchandise during recesses and visited the children at MINDS and interacted with them through games and performances. These activities not only raise the students’ awareness to the needs of others around them but also increase their sense of empathy and enable them to make use of their talents and gifts to help those in need.

***Computer Enrichment Programme and Cyberwellness***

As Information Technology (IT) is an integral part of Rosyth’s curriculum, students will be enrolled in the school-based Computer Enrichment Program upon joining Rosyth School and attend lessons on selected days after school-hours. Students who attend the programmes are adept in creating websites, operating multimedia equipments and using software such as Photoshop and Microsoft Office to assist them in their research work and studies.

Beside digital literacy, students will also be taught safe and responsible use of computers and the internet. Students who are keen may also sign up for the Cyberwellness Student Ambassador Programme and serve the school community as Cyberwellness Ambassadors. They will plan and arrange activities to share and promote Cyberwellness values in school.
