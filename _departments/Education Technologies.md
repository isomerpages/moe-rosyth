<h3>VISION</h3>
<p><strong><em>Empowering Future Ready Learners through the Use of ICT</em></strong>
</p>
<h3>EdTech PROGRAMMES</h3>
<p>Rosyth School has benefited from the flexibility and autonomy through
the devolution of ICT funds. Moving away from the standard provision of
ICT equipment has given us the freedom to better choose our ICT tools that
would allow us to cater to the needs and abilities of our pupils. Our ICT
vision can now be driven by our educational goals and objectives, rather
than by the standard provision of technologies.</p>
<p>We are able to equip ourselves with the appropriate ICT tools to experiment,
contextualize and boost current teaching pedagogies. It has certainly empowered
us to leverage on ICT as a platform to enhance our teaching and school
processes. Amongst the varied technologies that we hold are graphic tablets,
handhelds, interactive whiteboards and video production equipment. Students
are empowered to learn with technology through the following framework,
which empowers them to be future ready creators and learners.

<p>Computational Thinking, Coding and Robotics are also infused into our
curriculum. In the process, they learn how to solve real world problems
with technology and improve the lives of those around them. The Rosyth
Imagine Cup is a milestone programme and challenge that all students participate
in to create meaningful projects with Scratch and the Microbit. Our students
were also featured by the international Telecommunication Union (ITU) as
they embarked on the Lab on Wheels Program.</p>
