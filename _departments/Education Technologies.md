### VISION

***Empowering Future Ready Learners through the Use of ICT***

### EdTech PROGRAMMES

Rosyth School has benefited from the flexibility and autonomy through the devolution of ICT funds. Moving away from the standard provision of ICT equipment has given us the freedom to better choose our ICT tools that would allow us to cater to the needs and abilities of our pupils. Our ICT vision can now be driven by our educational goals and objectives, rather than by the standard provision of technologies.

We are able to equip ourselves with the appropriate ICT tools to experiment, contextualize and boost current teaching pedagogies. It has certainly empowered us to leverage on ICT as a platform to enhance our teaching and school processes. Amongst the varied technologies that we hold are graphic tablets, handhelds, interactive whiteboards and video production equipment. Students are empowered to learn with technology through the following framework, which empowers them to be future ready creators and learners. <br>

Computational Thinking, Coding and Robotics are also infused into our curriculum. In the process, they learn how to solve real world problems with technology and improve the lives of those around them. The Rosyth Imagine Cup is a milestone programme and challenge that all students participate in to create meaningful projects with Scratch and the Microbit. Our students were also featured by the international Telecommunication Union (ITU) as they embarked on the Lab on Wheels Program.
