##### SIGNATURE PROGRAMMES

**A) STELLAR Programme**

As part of the Rosyth School strategic thrusts, the STELLAR @ Rosyth programme seeks to develop our pupils holistically with a comprehensive, stimulating and engaging instructional programme.

**The objectives of the programme are as follows:**

* To employ a variety of effective teaching and learning pedagogies that focus on WHAT and HOW students are learning (i.e. more learner–centred)
* To have a balanced and holistic assessment of our pupils.

It supports the current syllabus and is in line with the 2010 English Language Syllabus. It aims to mover learners towards independence using quality children's books and activities that motivate and engage young learners.

During STELLAR lessons, children are exposed to more speaking and listening activities. Children learn reading and writing using varied and interesting books, with discussion, enriched with children's written language and filled with various reading materials for children to use. Teachers use a variety of print and non-print resources and children are exposed to literature and different texts to promote the writing. Learning Centres are created in classroom for independent small group learning. This provides the reinforcement and extension of teacher-guided lessons and language-experiential activities. Through interdepartment collaboration, lower primary children are also introduced to early Science in the English Curriculum. At P3, the children learn about environmental care and write about it as part of Writing . In essence, this collaboration will bring about greater engagement and meaning for the learning of skills and values within the existing curriculum.

**B) Bookflood Programme**

One of the objectives of the English Language programme at Rosyth is to promote reading among our students. As such, we have put in place a reading programme for all pupils from P1-P6. This programme which consists of bookflood books for all pupils aims to stimulate students’ interest in reading, increase their knowledge and widen their vocabulary through a variety of reading materials and exposure to a wide array of genres and text types. Each class is provided with a set of such books which are loaned out to students on a regular basis.

Rationale for Programme: 

* Read and respond to a variety of texts and demonstrate a positive attitude towards reading and language
* Demonstrate knowledge about language and text types
* Use reading strategies to construct meaning
* Listen to/Read/View a variety of texts and demonstrate understanding of content in oral/written form
* Read: Language for Literary Response and Expression, Language for Social Interaction and language for Information
* Listen to/Read/View a variety of texts which can be demonstrated in oral or written form the ability to acquire and use knowledge for a variety of purposes
* Develop pupils’ vocabulary by introducing them to a rich repertoire of vocabulary through a varied reading diet

**C) Literature@Rosyth**

As part of our effort to enhance our reading programme, Literature is incorporated into the curriculum for selected pupils from Primary 3 - 5 Through this programme, we hope to provide pupils with a greater appreciation of the various literary elements in a story, deepen comprehension skills, build on vocabulary and develop a joy for reading.

***P3 Text***

The novel ‘Frindle’ written by Andrew Clements is selected. It is a humourous tale about a boy and his ingenious ideas related to the origin of words. The novel will enable pupils to explore themes such as friendship and teacher-pupils relationships. Apart from exploring the themes, the novel will also introduce pupils to literary elements such as plot, character analysis and point of view through discussions, which will enhance their thinking and reasoning skills.

***P4 Text***

The novel ‘Charlotte’s Web’ written by E.B. White is selected. It is a notable classic about the friendship between Wilbur the pig and a barn spider named Charlotte. Apart from exploring the theme on friendship the novel will also introduce pupils to literary elements such as plot, character analysis and point of view through discussions, which will enhance their thinking and reasoning skills.

***P5 Text***

The novel ‘Sing to the Dawn’ written by Minfong Ho is selected. It is a tale about the relationship between two siblings and the emotions they go through in deciding who gets to further their studies. Apart from exploring the theme on sibling relationship, the novel will also introduce pupils to literary elements such as plot, character analysis and point of view through discussions, which will enhance their thinking and reasoning skills.

**D) Language BUZZ**

The Speak Good English Movement is a nation-wide campaign to promote the habit of using and speaking Standard English amongst Singaporeans in our daily lives . In Rosyth School, we emphasise the usage of English with correct grammar and pronunciation. We also encourage our pupils to express their feelings.

Pupils need to learn express themselves well as these are crucial for oral communication and understanding. To promote the use of good English in Speaking, Reading, Writing and Listening, a host of engaging activities are planned throughout the year in the form of Language BUZZ to arouse pupils' interest in the speaking of the language. Examples of some of these activities include NLB Bulk Borrowing (Read, Swap, Share), Presentations by Reading Ambassadors and Readers’ Theatre.

Pupils are provided with opportunities to perform to their classmates, pupils in other classes as well as the general school population. This is in alignment with the student outcomes of C2015 which focus on nurturing each child into a confident person, self-directed learner, self- directed learner, active contributor and concerned citizen.

Through the various school programs, we hope that Rosythians will be able to use English to communicate well with each other and build happy relationships. Teachers and parents are especially important in this initiative as we are the main facilitators who play a very important role in the acquisition and usage of Standard English.

**E) Primary 1 Moo-O PiSP (Parents-in-School Programme)**

The Moo-O programme has been incorporated into the P1-3 English curriculum in Rosyth. It uses a reading software that transforms the way stories are read and enjoyed, by involving the readers in the virtual story world as story characters. It is designed to help children read well, by letting them experience and understand how by reading fluently and expressively, they can enjoy their stories better. The software brings about the development of oracy amongst students and it is aligned to the self-directed and collaborative learning initiatives as identified in our 21st CC skills.

The programme has provided the school with the opportunity to build successful partnerships with our parents that are in the interests of our children through the implementation of the Primary 1 Moo-O PiSP (Parents-in-School Programme) during Curriculum Time. This programme aims to enhance the level of parental involvement in the school curriculum and hence, greater partnership with parents in the child’s learning.

**F) Learning Support Programme**

The Learning Support Programme (LSP) is an early intervention programme aimed at providing additional support to pupils who enter Primary 1 with weak English language and literacy skills. Its objective is to equip the pupils with basic reading and spelling skills.
Pupils are identified for the LSP through the Early Literacy Indicators (ELI), a group-screening instrument developed by MOE, at the beginning of each year. Pupils attaining low levels on the ELI (Levels 0, 1 and 2) are placed in the LSP for additional support.

**G) PREP with MUMs @ Rosyth**

PREP with MUMs @ Rosyth is a programme that aims to equip weak readers with the reading skills necessary for their daily school work. The programme also aims to help pupils cultivate good reading habits and ignite their love for reading so that in time to come, these pupils will become successful readers who will no longer learn to read but rather, they will read at more appropriately challenging levels in order to read to learn.

**Enhanced PREP with MUMs** exposes students to word games, student collaboration and class presentations. There are opportunities for independent learning through book reviews. The programme provides deep learning to enhance greater student motivation through vocabulary lists and reading logs.

**H) Extensive Reading Programme**

The Extensive Reading Programme involves ring-fencing weekly one-period lessons for reading activities for all students. For P1 & 2 students, library activities are compiled into a teacher-designed booklet and differentiated to arouse interest. Students earn tokens upon completion of tasks. The different activities give the students autonomy when they explore texts of different genres and plan their completion on their own, thus developing self-directedness in learning.

**I) Read@Rosyth**

The annual school-wide initiative, Read@Rosyth includes “It’s Storytime!” book sharing and “Book Character Day”. “It’s Storytime!” allows students to participate in the reading of their favourite book, giving them full autonomy of what they would like to present. “Book Character Day” evokes interest in students when teachers dress up as book characters.
