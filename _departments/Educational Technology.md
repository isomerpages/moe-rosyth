<h3>EdTech PROGRAMMES</h3>
<p>Rosyth School adopts a whole-school approach to digital literacies, anchored
in its newly launched Digital Literacies Framework aligned with the EdTech
Masterplan 2030. Students develop critical digital competencies and technological
skills through progressive, level-based programmes such as Scratch coding,
digital media creation, AI storytelling and real-world problem-solving
with the Micro:bit. Signature initiatives like the Rosyth Imagine Cup challenge
P5 and P6 students to innovate and apply their learning using design thinking
and service-learning models. The Makerspace ecosystem comprising physical,
mobile and eMakerspace, enables hands-on creation, while the Junior Academy
of Makers (JAM) empowers older students to lead peer workshops. Complemented
by the Cyber Wellness Student Ambassador Programme, these initiatives foster
compassionate, collaborative and future-ready learners.

<p>Computational Thinking, Coding and Robotics are also infused into our
curriculum. In the process, they learn how to solve real world problems
with technology and improve the lives of those around them. Our students
were also featured by the international Telecommunication Union (ITU) as
they embarked on the Lab on Wheels Program.</p>
