<p>With the restrictions of the real-world still undiscovered, children are
often the best innovators. We wanted to catch them young and instil in
them innovation as their way of thinking and behaviour.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Innovation does not happen magically, but it is an ongoing process
of intentional exploration. This led to the birth of the <strong>Period</strong>  <strong>PHI*</strong> (<strong>P</strong>assion <strong>H</strong>our <strong>I</strong>ngenuity)
curriculum. Our Period PHI modules are conducted in a fun and discovery
manner to inspire Rosythians to use their imagination to create and be
innovative thinkers, themselves!</p>
<p>&nbsp; For the Primary 1s to 6s, Period PHI occurs as a fortnightly 1
to 1.5-hour curriculum to spark our studentsâ€™ curiosities and inculcate
an innovation quotient in them. Rosythians learn how to use the Rosyth
7E Innovation Protocol for value creation and be exposed to mindsets needed
for innovation to take place.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Through our school-based innovative thinking programme, we hope
to nurture Rosythians who empathise, ask questions, think in new ways and
are willing to take insightful actions to add new value to others.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Equally important, through Period PHI, we purposefully teach Rosythians
the language and dispositions to work collaboratively and the different
techniques they can tap on to communicate effectively with one another.
They also learn presentation and publicity skills on how to excite the
audience with their innovation!</p>
<p>&nbsp; Over the years, as our Period PHI curriculum gained momentum, we
have been consistently recognised at various platforms and most notably,
affirmed at the Ministry of Education <strong>(MOE) Innergy Schools Award </strong>(Teaching
and Learning).</p>
