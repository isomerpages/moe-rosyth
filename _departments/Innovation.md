<p><strong>Period PHI (Passion Hour Ingenuity): Igniting Passion and Purpose through Innovation</strong>
</p>
<p>Period PHI is a school-based innovation programme conducted fortnightly
for 1 to 1.5 hours. It is designed to ignite passion and purpose in our
students through the PHI Windmill Framework, which integrates the Rosyth
7E Innovation Protocol with principles from Ikigai, a Japanese concept
referring to one’s sense of purpose or reason for being. Ikigai is found
at the intersection of four elements: what you love, what you are good
at, what the world needs, and what you can be valued for.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The PHI Windmill is designed to bring together the two key components:</p>
<p>•Four blades inspired by Ikigai principles</p>
<p>•A lollipop-shaped core representing the Rosyth 7E Innovation Protocol</p>
<p></p>

<p>Through this framework, students explore their strengths and interests
while applying innovative thinking to contribute meaningfully to others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The PHI programme comprises 3 core modules:</p>
<p>I.Passion T-Time: Teachers inspire students by sharing personal passions,
encouraging them to explore and experience new interests.</p>
<p>II.Roszania: Students learn about different occupations through realistic
role-play, gaining insights into how professions contribute to society.</p>
<p>III.Innovation: Students apply the 7E Innovation Protocol to design creative
solutions that improve lives, blending empathy, purpose and innovation
in action.</p>
<p><strong>Developing Innovative Creators and 21st Century Competencies (21CC)</strong>
</p>
<p>Period PHI supports Rosyth’s desired student outcome of developing Innovative
Creators who think critically and creatively to solve authentic problems,
act with empathy, and design purposeful solutions that benefit others.</p>
<p>The programme emphasises that innovation is not just invention, but finding
meaning and joy in creating value for the community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Period PHI is also a key vehicle for developing 21CC. It equips
students with adaptive and inventive thinking, collaboration, communication
and civic literacy skills.</p>
<p>Students learn to work collaboratively, communicate effectively, and present
their ideas confidently. They also develop the ability to excite and inspire
others through creative expression and purposeful innovation.</p>
