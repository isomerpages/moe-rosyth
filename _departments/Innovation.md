### MISSION

***To Ignite the Innovation Quotient in every Rosythian***

Innovation does not happen magically, but it is an ongoing process of intentional exploration. This led to the birth of the **Period PHI** (**P**assion **H**our **I**ngenuity) curriculum. Our Period PHI modules are conducted in a fun and discovery manner to inspire Rosythians to use their imagination to create and be innovative thinkers, themselves!

For the Primary 1s to 6s, Period PHI occurs as a fortnightly 1 to 1.5-hour curriculum to spark our studentsâ€™ curiosities and inculcate an innovation quotient in them. Rosythians learn how to use the Rosyth 7E Innovation Protocol for value creation and be exposed to mindsets needed for innovation to take place. 

Through our school-based innovative thinking programme, we hope to nurture Rosythians who empathise, ask questions, think in new ways and are willing to take insightful actions to add new value to others.

Equally important, through Period PHI, we purposefully teach Rosythians the language and dispositions to work collaboratively and the different techniques they can tap on to communicate effectively with one another. They also learn presentation and publicity skills on how to excite the audience with their innovation!

Over the years, as our Period PHI curriculum gained momentum, we have been consistently recognised at various platforms and most notably, affirmed at the Ministry of Education **(MOE) Innergy Schools Award** (Teaching and Learning).
