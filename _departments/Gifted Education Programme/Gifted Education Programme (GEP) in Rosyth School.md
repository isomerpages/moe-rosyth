### VISION

***A Love For Learning and Learning to Love***

[Learning Experience ](https://rosyth.moe.edu.sg/ge-school-experience)

##### DESIRED OUTCOMES

Students are engaged individually and in small groups, or as a class, challenged by knowledge, concepts and skills in the various disciplines, as well as through interdisciplinary approaches.

Every child is different. He has strengths or talents. He is helped and guided, and recognised and acknowledged as an individual. The challenge is in creating a greater love and thirst for knowledge and skills and this motivation will help each one succeed in life.

Students learn in a community, in an extended family called the Rosythian family. They learn to accept themselves, and others in class, and learn to work and live harmoniously with others in the school. They are also exposed to other communities outside the school in the hope that they would learn to sympathise or even empathise with others.
