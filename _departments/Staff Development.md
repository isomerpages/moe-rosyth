#### The Singapore Teachers Vision

Written by teachers, for teachers through an envisioning exercise in which schools island-wide participated in through Teachers Conversations at zone and school level.

Singapore Teachers: Lead. Care. Inspire
By word and deed, through the care we give, we touch the lives of our students. We make a difference - leading and inspiring our students to believe in themselves and to be the best they can be.

As individuals and as a community of professionals, we seek continually to deepen our expertise. Respectful of fellow educators, we collaborate to build a strong fraternity, taking pride in our work and profession.

We forge trusting partnerships with families and the community for the growth and well-being of each student.
We Lead, Care, Inspire,
For the Future of the Nation Passes through Our Hands.
