### VISION <br>
***A School of Active and Physically Competent Individuals***


##### INTRODUCTION <br>

The purpose of physical education is to enable students to demonstrate individually and with others, the physical skills, practices and values to enjoy a lifetime of active, healthy living.

Physical education programme thus is an integral component of Rosyth School curriculum.  It provides our students with learning opportunities that make use of movement to develop the whole person.

At the Rosyth School, students learn the fundamental movement skills incorporating the movement concepts.  They develop efficiency, effectiveness and versatility in their performance as they practice and transfer their skills across the seven learning areas of Athletics, Dance, Games and Sports, Gymnastics, Outdoor Education, Physical Health and Fitness, and Swimming to become competent movers.

With the broadbased development of physical competencies, everyone is able to continue participating at a recreational level.

##### OUR SIGNATURE PROGRAMMES <br>

**PROGRAMME FOR ACTIVE LEARNING (PAL)**<br>

Programme for Active Learning (PAL) is aimed at providing a greater emphasis on non-academic programmes for all Primary 1 and 2 students.  PAL is part of the curriculum and offered during time-tabled time. In PAL, students are exposed to varied and fun learning experiences in four domains: Sports and Games, Outdoor Education, Performing Arts and Visual Arts.  During PAL, students are taught socio-emotional competencies such as respecting others and responsible decision making. PAL nurtures confidence, curiosity and cooperation skills in students.

**LOWER PRIMARY SPORTS DAY**<br>

The Lower Primary Sports Day (P1 to P2) is held every year as part of the National Day celebrations. The event is aimed at providing the students with the opportunity to apply the motor skills learnt in the PE syllabus in the form of relay games to cultivate the various ICARE values.  It also develops the camaraderie in students as they compete and cheer on their classmates.  All students will participate in at least two relay events competing with other classes in the same level.  These relay events would involve skills such as throwing and catching a ball, dribbling a ball with/without an equipment implement, and performing general locomotor movements such as running and balancing.  Everyone is a winner during LPS Day as we celebrate our nation’s birthday and goes home with a medal.

**SWIMSAFER** <br>

The SwimSafer™ 2.0 is a National Water Safety Programme in Singapore designed to teach participants how to stay safe around aquatic environments. The programme aims to teach swimming proficiency and water survival skills in a fun manner.

**IDARE Series** <br>

The IDARE Series (P3 to P6) are school-based Student Development Experiences (SDE) that provide students with experiences that cannot be replicated in the classroom.  Students go through activities such as rope climbing, Skyline Luge, Dragonboating, Laser and Archery Tag, 12km North Eastern Riverine Loop Hike.  These activities are aimed at providing authentic contexts in which students apply what they have learnt from Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) and Outdoor Education in Physical Education (OE in PE) lessons. 
The richness and complexity of experiences, such as working with their peers to overcome challenges or navigating in a new environment during a journey, allow them to extend and deepen their learning from the classroom into real-life.

### Co-Curricular Activities (CCA)

##### INTRODUCTION <br>

The CCA Programme provides students with a platform to discover their interests and talents. Well-organised and implemented, they can fuel in the individual a life-long love for a particular activity, be it a sport or a musical pursuit. This helps the individual to lead a balanced life in adulthood. 

Each CCA has its specific objectives. For instance, Physical Sports (PS) develop robustness, fair play and team spirit in pupils. The Visual and Performing Arts (VPA) instil in students a sense of graciousness and an appreciation for the rich culture and heritage of a multi-racial society. Uniformed Group (UG) activities aim to make good citizens of students by inculcating in them self-reliance, resilience, discipline and a spirit of service to others. Clubs and Societies (CS) allow students to explore and extend their interests in wide ranging and specialised areas which may be knowledge-based or skills-based. Students are honed in information, communication and technical skills as they strive to grow their mastery of the specialised areas.

Students progressively develop CCA-specific knowledge, skills, values and attitudes through sustained participation in any of the CCA groups. CCA also offer excellent platforms for students to learn core values, social and emotional competencies and the emerging 21st Century Competencies. 

All CCA emphasise social interaction by providing a common space for friendships and social integration amongst students of diverse backgrounds. Through CCA, students develop a sense of identity and belonging to the school.
