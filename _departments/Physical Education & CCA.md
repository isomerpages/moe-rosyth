<h5>OUR SIGNATURE PROGRAMMES</h5>
<p></p>
<p><strong>PROGRAMME FOR ACTIVE LEARNING (PAL)</strong>
</p>
<p>Programme for Active Learning (PAL) is aimed at providing a greater emphasis
on non-academic programmes for all Primary 1 and 2 students. PAL is part
of the curriculum and offered during time-tabled time. In PAL, students
are exposed to varied and fun learning experiences in four domains: Sports
and Games, Outdoor Education, Performing Arts and Visual Arts. During PAL,
students are taught socio-emotional competencies such as respecting others
and responsible decision making. PAL nurtures confidence, curiosity and
cooperation skills in students.</p>

<p></p>
<p><strong>LOWER PRIMARY SPORTS DAY</strong>
</p>
<p>The Lower Primary Sports Day (P1 to P2) is held every year as part of
the Children’s Day celebrations. The event is aimed at providing the students
with the opportunity to apply the motor skills learnt in the PE syllabus
in the form of games to cultivate the various ICARE values. It also develops
the camaraderie in students as they compete and cheer on their classmates.
All students will participate in at least two events competing with other
classes in the same level. These relay events would involve skills such
as throwing and catching a ball, dribbling a ball with/without an equipment
implement, and performing general locomotor movements such as running and
balancing. Everyone is a winner and goes home with a medal.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>SWIMSAFER 2.0</strong>
</p>
<p>The SwimSafer™ 2.0 is a National Water Safety Programme in Singapore designed
to teach participants how to stay safe around aquatic environments. The
programme aims to teach swimming proficiency and water survival skills
in a fun manner.</p>

<p><strong>PRIMARY 5 OUTDOOR ADVENTURE LEARNING (OAL) CAMP</strong>
</p>
<p>The Primary 5 OAL Camp is a key Student Development Experiences (SDE),
under the CCE curriculum as well as serves as an extension of the Outdoor
Education in the PE curriculum. The camp provides opportunities for students
to apply their learning in an authentic context through a variety of outdoor
living experiences and adventurous activities.</p>

<p></p>
<p><strong>IDARE SERIES</strong>
</p>
<p>The I-Dare Series (P3 to P6) are school-based Student Development Experiences
(SDE) that provide students with experiences that cannot be replicated
in the classroom. Students go through activities such as Orienteering,
Skyline Luge, Dragonboating, Sport Climbing, and the 12km North Eastern
Riverine Loop Hike. These activities are aimed at providing authentic contexts
in which students apply what they have learnt from Character and Citizenship
Education (CCE) and Outdoor Education in Physical Education (OE in PE)
lessons. The richness and complexity of experiences, such as working with
their peers to overcome challenges or navigating in a new environment during
a journey, allow them to extend and deepen their learning from the classroom
into real-life.</p>

<p></p>
<h3>CO-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES (CCA)</h3>
<p>The CCA Programme provides students with a platform to discover their
interests and talents. Well-organised and implemented, they can fuel in
the individual a life-long love for a particular activity, be it a sport
or a musical pursuit. This helps the individual to lead a balanced life
in adulthood.</p>
<p>Each CCA has its specific objectives. For instance, Physical Sports (PS)
develop robustness, fair play and team spirit in pupils. The Visual and
Performing Arts (VPA) instil in students a sense of graciousness and an
appreciation for the rich culture and heritage of a multi-racial society.
Uniformed Group (UG) activities aim to make good citizens of students by
inculcating in them self-reliance, resilience, discipline and a spirit
of service to others. Clubs and Societies (CS) allow students to explore
and extend their interests in wide ranging and specialised areas which
may be knowledge-based or skills-based. Students are honed in information,
communication and technical skills as they strive to grow their mastery
of the specialised areas.</p>
<p>Students progressively develop CCA-specific knowledge, skills, values
and attitudes through sustained participation in any of the CCA groups.
CCA also offer excellent platforms for students to learn core values, social
and emotional competencies and the emerging 21st Century Competencies.</p>
<p>All CCA emphasise social interaction by providing a common space for friendships
and social integration amongst students of diverse backgrounds. Through
CCA, students develop a sense of identity and belonging to the school.</p>
