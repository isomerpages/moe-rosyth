<h3>KEY PROGRAMMES</h3>
<p></p>
<p><strong>VALUES-IN-ACTION (VIA)</strong>
</p>
<p>We aim to cultivate empathy and compassion, teaching them the value of
understanding and supporting others through our VIA projects. We believe
that this holistic approach to education equips our students with the skills
and qualities they need to thrive in a rapidly changing world, making them
not only successful individuals but also responsible global citizens.</p>
<p>Designed for Primary 4 to Primary 6 students, our VIA programme is a journey
of self-discovery and growth. Through structured activities and teachers’
guidance, we empower students to plan and implement their own VIA projects.
This develops greater self-awareness and self-management skills in students,
enabling them to use their talents to help those who are in need and exemplifies
our school motto “Ready to Serve”.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Computer Enrichment Programme (CEP)</strong>
</p>
<p>In today's digital age, computer literacy is paramount. Our Computer Enrichment
Programme (CEP) offers students an exciting opportunity to delve into the
world of technology. Beyond learning the basics, students embark on an
enriching journey of exploration and innovation. Whether it is coding,
digital creativity, or problem-solving, this programme equips students
with the skills to thrive in the digital landscape, preparing them for
a future full of possibilities.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Inquiry Skills(IS)/Individualised Study Option (ISO)</strong>
</p>
<p>At Primary 4 and Primary 5, students are empowered to take charge of their
learning through passion-driven exploration. Designed to develop critical
thinking, research skills, and independent learning, the inquiry skills/individualized
study option allow students to delve into topics of personal interest while
receiving guided support from teacher mentors. This approach fosters creativity,
problem-solving, and self-motivation—preparing students to be future ready
in an ever-evolving world.</p>
