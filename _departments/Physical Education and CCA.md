### VISION
***A School of Active and Physically Competent Individuals***

##### DESIRED OUTCOMES

The purpose of physical education is to enable students to demonstrate individually and with others the physical skills, practices, and values to enjoy a lifetime of active, healthy living.

The physical education programme develops students who:

***A) Learning How to Move Well***

* have a range of skills through participation in regular and varied physical education experiences.
	* These skills enable students to enjoy movement, discover interests, and achieve personal goals related to participation in physical activity.
* possess competency in movement.
	* This provides the foundation for continual skill acquisition and facilitates future successful participation in physical activity resulting from changing life patterns.

***B) Learning through Movement***
* have sufficient knowledge related to movement experiences.
	* An understanding about how to move allows students to make informed decisions in relation to work and recreation. This includes movement concepts, principles and theories, game rules, tactics and strategies, health- and fitness-related benefits, and environmental risks and personal safety concerns.
* have extensive knowledge base about movement across a wide variety of settings, within and outside of school, to help generalise and transfer learning to new and challenging real-life physical activity.
	* More importantly, students develop the ability to transfer knowledge to additional skills while continuing to refine existing ones as self-directed and independent learners.

***C) Learning about Movement***
* take deliberate actions to be involved in safe physical activities that help to develop health-related physical fitness: muscular strength and endurance, aerobic capacity, flexibility, agility, and body composition.
	* Students plan, monitor, and assess their physical fitness status and activity patterns using established fitness assessment tools, and compare the results to age- and gender-specific standards that contribute towards good health.
* enjoy and value the benefits of daily physical activities.
	* Students who value active living while young are more likely as adults to continue this practice and advocate an active and balanced lifestyle.
