<h3>Guiding Principle in Student Management</h3>
<p>In accordance to Rosyth School’s mission of nurturing lives through the
development of mind, body and soul, the school’s Student Management Department
aims to create a safe and conducive environment so that learning can be
maximised. It is therefore important that all students formed positive
behaviours, and respectful and caring relationships in school to uphold
the highest standard of the school’s I-CARE values. This is the key purpose
and function of Student Management in Rosyth School.</p>
