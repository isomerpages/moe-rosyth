<h3>VISION</h3>
<p><strong><em>Every Rosythian, An Active Global Citizen of Character</em></strong>
</p>
<h3>MISSION</h3>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>To deliver values-based programmes for development of 21st Century Competencies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instilling the spirit of Active Citizenry in our students.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5>Introduction</h5>
<p>To develop Rosythians holistically through a coherent, robust and engaging
co-curriculum where students are given good exposure and authentic learning
experiences with CCA as key leverage to become passionate learners and
confident leaders who serve the larger community with compassion.</p>
<p>Through purposeful programming, scaling across the six levels of education
and strong partnerships, Rosyth School takes a whole school approach in
the holistic development of our Rosythians, anchored on our school’s I-CA<strong>R</strong>E
values.</p>
<h5>CCE Lessons</h5>
<p><strong>CCE (FTGP)</strong>
</p>
<p>Our structured CCE Form Teacher Guidance Period <strong>CCE (FTGP)</strong> curriculum
develops our students’ social-emotional competencies in a safe and supportive
learning environment. The curriculum includes</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>

<p>At Rosyth, we focus on the cultivation of a “Growth Mindset”, with emphasis
on effort and positivity. We recognise that all students are capable of
developing resilience by tapping on their internal strengths and external
resources. Using a strength approach of I Am, I Can &amp; I Have, we equip
our Rosythians with the knowledge, values and competencies to enhance their
resilience and positivity. Growth Mindset lessons are carried out using
a four-stage approach during CCE(FTGP) lessons. The table below shows a
series of lessons taught over six years.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>CCE (MTL)</strong>
</p>
<p>CCE Lessons in Mother Tongue Language <strong>CCE (MTL)</strong> enhance
the teaching of moral&nbsp;values through cultural stories, songs, idioms,
and proverbs unique to each Mother Tongue Language.</p>
<p><strong>PAL</strong>
</p>
<p>Programme for Active Learning <strong>(PAL)</strong> reinforces the teaching
of socio-emotional competencies at Primary 1 and Primary 2 in non-academic
domains.</p>
<p><strong>VALUES MOMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p>Values Moments are structured time during school assembly to address school’s
concerns like timeliness, cleanliness and bite-size factors, which are
important considerations in our whole-school approach and to sustain efforts
for the inculcation of values.</p>
<h5>Student Development</h5>
<p>We envision Rosythians to grow up as leaders in their own lives as they
take on different leadership roles in their development, set goals to pursue
their dreams and value the talents within themselves, thereby blossoming
into confident and fulfilled individuals.</p>
<p>Rosyth Leadership Development Programme is a six-year programme spanning
from Primary 1 to Primary 6.&nbsp; It is structured according to C.A.R.E
leadership (Caring, Alert, Responsible, Exemplary) for Primary 1-3 and
Leadership Challenge Model by Jim Kouzes and Barry Posner for Primary 4-6.</p>

<p>Every Rosythian is nurtured with values and skills of a student mentor
to be:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>a C.A.R.ing Buddy who <strong>C</strong>ares, shows gr<strong>A</strong>titude,
and <strong>R</strong>espects others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a good role model who models the way and leads by example.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a supportive mentor who can use the CHEER model to help others.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5>National Education</h5>
<p>Rosythians take part in meaningful celebrations of Singapore’s cultural
diversity and commemorations of significant days of nation-building throughout
the year.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/CCE5.jpg">
</div>
<p>National Education Cohort learning journeys also take place as extensions
of the Instructional Programme. Activities are planned to promote active
citizenry amongst pupils. Rosythians consolidate their learning experiences
through structured avenues that allow them to reflect deeply and to share
with the rest of the student population. Recognising the increasing need
for Singaporeans to be global in outlook and to be able to operate in multi-national
settings, Rosyth School provides overseas immersion programmes which are
aimed at strengthening the students’ commitment and rootedness to Singapore
and builds future-ready competencies.</p>
<h5>Values in Action (VIA)</h5>
<p>Values in Action (VIA) are Key Student Developmental Experiences that
play a pivotal role in nurturing Rosythians with a heart to serve. We adopt
a 6-year plan with clear learning outcomes based on Circle of Love. Some
level-wide signature programmes are Appreciation Day for school staff,
Love Our Community and Care Carnival.</p>
<p>To cultivate in our Rosythians a sense of responsibility and care for
their own space and shared spaces, Rosyth incorporates daily cleaning activities
in class every day. Through daily practice, our students cultivate good
life habits. &nbsp;&nbsp;To provide authentic experiences for our students
to serve the community and display their strengths and talents, our CCAs
design and implement customized service-learning opportunities which leverage
students’ skills and competencies that have been developed in the CCA.</p>
