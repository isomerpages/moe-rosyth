Every year, Primary 6 students are involved in raising funds for a beneficiary of their choice. They will conduct research about the organisation and share with their classmates why they have chosen to be a voice for this particular beneficiary.

These are the beneficiaries which have benefitted from the fund-raising during the P6 Care Carnival.

1.  Children’s Cancer Foundation
2.  Children’s Aid Society
