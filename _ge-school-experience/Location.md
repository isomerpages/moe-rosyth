As the school grew in numbers and strength, it was evident that it needed a new building to meet the needs of 21st century education. From 2012 to 2013, the present premise underwent PERI Upgrading and the school was relocated to a temporary holding site (the previous ITE college West) along Ang Mo Kio Avenue 5. In 2014, it moved back to its original site at Serangoon North Avenue 4 and went single session in 2015.
