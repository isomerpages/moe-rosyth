Rosyth School was established in 1956. Over the years, it has been recognised for its holistic development and character-building of its students. At the end of 1983, it was selected as one of the two primary schools to host the Gifted Education Programme.

The school has a strong emphasis on values inculcation, which is undergirded by our school motto and I-Care values. It is our hope that all Rosythians will become global citizens, equipped with 21st century skills to thrive in the ever-changing world.

Do you know that Rosyth was situated at Rosyth Road from which it derived its name?
