<p>Dear Ex-Rosythians,</p>
<p>We welcome all Ex-Rosythians to return to Rosyth School to visit your
teachers during this Lunar New year. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Date : 12 February 2025 (Wed)</p>
<p>Time : 4pm to 5pm</p>
<p>Venue : Indoor Sports Hall (ISH), Rosyth School</p>
<p>For the visit to be meaningful, we suggest that students arrive latest
by 4.45pm as you will need to vacate the premises at 5pm. You should remain
in the ISH throughout the visit. We request that you do not run or play
games in the ISH or at any other location to make sure everyone has a safe
and enjoyable experience.</p>
<p>We trust that our ex-Rosythians will continue to uphold the right values
that they have learnt in school and continue to set a good example for
our current Rosythians. Your former teachers would love to hear updates
from you â€“ so do come prepared to fill them in!</p>
<p>We look forward to your visit!</p>
