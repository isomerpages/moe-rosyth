<p>Dear Ex-Rosythians,</p>
<p>&nbsp;As we celebrate our 70th anniversary this year, there's no better
time to reconnect with the place where your journey began. All Ex-Rosythians
are welcomed to return to Rosyth School to visit your teachers during this
Lunar New Year. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;Date : 25 February 2026 (Wed)</p>
<p>Time : 4pm to 5pm</p>
<p>Venue : Indoor Sports Hall (ISH), Rosyth School</p>
<p>&nbsp;For the visit to be meaningful, we suggest that students arrive
latest by 4.45pm as you will need to vacate the premises at 5pm. To make
sure everyone has a safe and enjoyable experience, please remain in the
ISH throughout your visit and refrain from running or playing games while
on the school premises.</p>
<p>&nbsp;We look forward to your visit!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
