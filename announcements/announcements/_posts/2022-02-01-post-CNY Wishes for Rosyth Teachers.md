Dear Ex-Rosythians,

In view of the current Covid-19 situation and with the safe management measures in place, we will not be able to have the Ex-Rosythians’ CNY visit to meet your teachers this year.

Your lovely virtual CNY wishes and messages of gratitude sent through our online form will be relayed to your teachers. We would like to thank you for the heartening notes which will certainly make your teachers feel loved and appreciated. The online form is now closed and once again, we wish all of you a wonderful Lunar New Year.

Let’s all stay safe and healthy.
