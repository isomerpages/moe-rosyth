**Cancellation of Rosyth Alumni School Visit**

Dear Alumni,

On the eve of Polling Day, **Thursday, 31 Aug 2023**, school will end at 12.30pm and the General Office will be closed at 2pm. Hence, **the Rosyth Alumni School Visit will be cancelled**. Rosythians and ex-Rosythians who wish to share their well wishes and dedications for their teachers may do so online via the ‘iCARE for my teachers@Rosyth’ Padlet wall: [https://tinyurl.com/iCAREformyteachers](https://tinyurl.com/iCAREformyteachers)

For the password, recall which school value ‘A’ stands for in ‘iCARE’. It’s the name of this school value, all in small caps except the A, followed by 2023 (i.e. schoolvalue2023).
