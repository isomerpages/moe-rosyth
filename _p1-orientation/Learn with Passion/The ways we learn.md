My teachers make learning interesting and we learn in so many ways. For example, during Mother Tongue lessons, we role-play and act and the class is always filled with fun and laughter.

We learn through/with,

1.  Role-Play
2.  Games
3.  Experiments
4.  Group Work
5.  Technology

Learning is never dull in Rosyth and you have to experience it yourself!
