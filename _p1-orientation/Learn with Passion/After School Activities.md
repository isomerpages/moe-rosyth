I also visit the library and Makerspace frequently after school.

I read with my friends and share interesting books with them. There are also story telling and reading programmes on certain days after school.

If I have projects to do or need to borrow equipment to complete a task, I will visit the Makerspace and seek help from the friendly trainers.
