My elder sister is a Student Leader in Rosyth. As she is interested in the environment, she became an Environment Ambassador to advocate recycling.

Student Leadership in Rosyth
1.  Student Councillors
2.  Environment Ambassadors
3.  NE Ambassadors
4.  Cyber Wellness Ambassadors
5.  Cheer Buddies
6.  Class Ambassadors
7.  Subject Representatives in Class
8.  CCA Committee Members

I am inspired by what my sister does and I hope to be an Environment Ambassador too.
