<p><strong>Period PHI (Passion Hour Ingenuity): Igniting Passion and Purpose through Innovation</strong>
</p>
<p>Period PHI is a school-based innovation programme conducted fortnightly
for 1 to 1.5 hours from Primary 1 to 6. It is designed to ignite passion
and purpose in our students through the PHI Windmill Framework, which integrates
the Rosyth 7E Innovation Protocol with principles from Ikigai, a Japanese
concept referring to one’s sense of purpose or reason for being. Ikigai
is found at the intersection of four elements: what you love, what you
are good at, what the world needs, and what you can be valued for.</p>
<p>The PHI Windmill is designed to bring together the two key components:</p>
<p>•Four blades inspired by Ikigai principles</p>
<p>•A lollipop-shaped core representing the Rosyth 7E Innovation Protocol</p>
<p>Through this framework, students explore their strengths and interests
while applying innovative thinking to contribute meaningfully to others.</p>

<p><strong>Developing Innovative Creators</strong>
</p>
<p>Period PHI supports Rosyth’s desired student outcome of developing Innovative
Creators who think critically and creatively to solve authentic problems,
act with empathy and design purposeful solutions that benefit others.</p>
<p>The programme emphasises that innovation is not just invention, but finding
meaning and joy in creating value for the community.</p>
<p>Below is a sample lesson that the P1s will go through.</p>
