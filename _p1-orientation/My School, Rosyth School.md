Dear Diary,  

Have you ever wondered what I do in Rosyth School every day? Let me share with you!  

My school principal is Mdm Elis Tan and she welcomes me to school every day with a big and warm smile.

I am also surrounded by my teachers and classmates. My favourite teacher is my Form Teacher and she is someone I can always turn to when I need help.
