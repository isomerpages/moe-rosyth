Dear Diary,  

I love going to Rosyth School every day. There are many interesting activities that I do with my friends and teachers. I enjoy going to the Science Garden and the computer lab to learn. I also like the yummy chicken rice and noodles in the school canteen.

This is what some of my friends have to say about learning in Rosyth School.

I am still learning how to sing the Rosyth school song.
