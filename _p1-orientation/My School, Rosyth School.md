Dear Diary,  

Have you ever wondered what I do in Rosyth School every day? Let me share with you!  

My favourite teacher is my Form Teacher and she is someone I can always turn to when I need help. I am also surrounded by my other subject teachers and classmates. We have great fun learning and playing every day. You may view the following videos to learn about what our 2022 and 2021 P1 students have to say about Rosyth School. You can also listen to our School Song and learn how to sing it!

#### 2022 P1 Students

The video will be uploaded shortly.
