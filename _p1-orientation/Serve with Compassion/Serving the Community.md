As a Rosythian, I volunteer to serve my school and my community.

Every morning, I help my teachers to set up the PA system for Flag Raising and Assembly.

Some of us volunteer as “Pupils on Patrol” to assist Rosythians in need during the recesses.

We also work on community projects together. There are many ways to contribute. Some of us raise funds for the needy. Others may invent things to improve the lives of those around them. My P5 brother volunteered to teach the elderly how to code and use technological devices.
