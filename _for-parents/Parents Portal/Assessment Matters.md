</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; STUDENTS WHO ARE UNWELL ON DAY OF ASSESSMENT</strong>
</p>
<p>The school conducts a temperature-taking exercise at the start of every
day.<strong> If a student is unwell and/or has a temperature 38.0Â°C and above the school will contact his/her parents to fetch him/her home and seek medical advice.</strong> While
waiting, the child will be brought to the sick bay.</p>
<p>Teachers will also check that <strong>students who are supposed to be on medical leave do not remain in school to take the assessments</strong>.</p>
<p>The school requests that parents co-operate and assist in this matter.
Insisting that a child comes or remains in school when he/she is unwell
may mean that he/she is exposing the other students in the class to the
infection he/she has contracted. This is against the principle of social
responsibility which we constantly try to impart to our students, and it
will confuse the child.</p>
<p>It is also in the <strong>childâ€™s best interest not to be in school when he/she is unwell</strong>.
He/She will not be able to focus and do well for the tests he/she is taking
due to illness. He/she needs to stay home to rest. The marks he/she scores
may not be a fair reflection of his/her true ability.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ABSENCE FROM ASSESSMENT</strong>
</p>
<p>Students who are absent will be given the assessment papers as practice
and the marks will not be included in the overall mark computation.</p>
<p>Only the following are considered as <strong>valid reasons for absences</strong> during
assessments:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>medical reasons supported by a medical certificate (MC) from a doctor.
MCs from Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) practitioners are not accepted
except if the TCM clinic is under the purview of a hospital</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>bereavement of family members</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>COVID 19 ART+ on day of paper</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>parent letter explaining absence with valid reason (valid for WA/TA only)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>any other reason(s) deemed valid by the school</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A medical certificate or any other relevant documentation (e.g., death
certificate) must be given to the form teacher when the student returns
to school to support his/her absence.</p>
<p>All other reasons will be considered <strong>on a case-by-case basis subject to the schoolâ€™s approval.</strong>
</p>
<p>Students who are absent for an assessment <strong>with an invalid reason will get a zero mark for that assessment</strong> and
this assessment mark will be considered in the computation of the subject
and overall total.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ASSESSMENT MAKE-UP</strong>
</p>
<p>All assessments will be conducted as stated in the assessment schedule.
There is no assessment make-up for students who are absent except for oral
assessment, and the oral make-up will only be considered for students with
valid reason for absence.</p>
<p>For GEP students, do note that there is a separate guideline for students
who are absent for WA/EYE on a case-by-case basis. This guideline is only
applicable for GEP assessment subjects (i.e., English Language, Mathematics
and Science).</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; COMPUTATION OF SUBJECT TOTAL FOR STUDENTS WHO ARE ABSENT</strong>
</p>
<p>Computation of EYE Subject Total for a Student who is Absent for a Language
Component or Mathematics Paper</p>
<p>For English Language, Mother Tongue Language and Mathematics EYE, if a
student is <strong>absent with a valid reason for either a component or paper</strong>,
the marks for that assessment will not be included in the overall subject
total for the year if the weighting of the component or paper missed is <strong>20% and more</strong> of
the total weighting. This would mean that a VR (Valid Reason) will be reflected
in the Report Book, where relevant.</p>
<p><em>Example 1: Primary 5 English Language EYE</em>
</p>
<p>A student is absent with valid reason for Paper 1 which is less than 20%
of the total weighting</p>

<p><em>Example 2: Primary 5 Mathematics EYE</em>
</p>
<p>A student is absent with valid reason for Paper 1 which is 20% and more
of the total weighting</p>

<p><strong>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; QUALIFYING FOR SCHOOL-BASED ACADEMIC AWARDS</strong>
</p>
<p>To qualify for school-based academic awards the students<strong> must have assessment marks computed for ALL the assessments in that year (i.e., WAs/Prelim/EYE) for the academic subjects (i.e., English, Mathematics, Mother Tongue Languages(including NTIL) and Science)</strong>.
That is to say that should a child miss any of the assessments even with
Valid Reason(s), he/she would not qualify for school-based awards for that
year. They will continue to be eligible for Edusave Awards where relevant.</p>
<p>As there are only a few students taking Non-Tamil Indian Languages (NTIL)
and Mother Tongue in-lieu (foreign language), the school does not have
an Academic Excellence in Subject Awards for NTIL and foreign language
subjects. Students who are exempted from Mother Tongue Language are only
eligible for Academic Excellence in Subject Awards for English, Mathematics
and Science.</p>
<p>* Please refer to Section 9 on Computation of Subject Total for students
who are absent.</p>
<p>** Please note that qualification for the Edusave Awards/Scholarships
are based on a separate criteria and are not dependent on qualifying for
the school-based awards.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PROMOTION AND SUBJECT COMBINATION</strong>
