Mathematics Paper 2.</p>
<p>The following guidelines are to be adhered to in the use of calculators
in examinations:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The calculator must be silent, with a visual display only.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The working condition of the calculator (including the power supply) is
the responsibility of the candidates and any fault in the calculator will
not be considered as justification for special consideration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Candidates are not allowed to share calculators during the examination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No calculators with an external storage function which can allow users

</li>
<li>
<p>No calculators with wireless communication capability with other machines,
e.g., infra-red communication capability, are allowed.</p>
</li>

<p>Any enclosed instruction leaflets containing any mathematical formula,
conversion table or instructions are strictly prohibited, and must not
be taken into the examination venue. Any such information on the calculator
that cannot be removed must be securely covered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The original model number and brand must be indicated clearly on the calculator
for verification purposes.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p><strong>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; STUDENTS WHO ARE UNWELL ON DAY OF ASSESSMENT</strong>
</p>
<p>The school conducts a temperature-taking exercise at the start of every
day.<strong> If a student is unwell and/or has a temperature 38.0Â°C and above the school will contact his/her parents to fetch him/her home and seek medical advice.</strong> While
waiting, the child will be brought to the sick bay.</p>
<p>Teachers will also check that <strong>students who are supposed to be on medical leave do not remain in school to take the assessments</strong>.</p>
<p>The school requests that parents co-operate and assist in this matter.
Insisting that a child comes or remains in school when he/she is unwell
may mean that he/she is exposing the other students in the class to the
infection he/she has contracted. This is against the principle of social
responsibility which we constantly try to impart to our students, and it
will confuse the child.</p>
<p>It is also in the <strong>childâ€™s best interest not to be in school when he/she is unwell</strong>.
He/She will not be able to focus and do well for the tests he/she is taking
due to illness. He/she needs to stay home to rest. The marks he/she scores
may not be a fair reflection of his/her true ability.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ABSENCE FROM ASSESSMENT</strong>
</p>
<p>Students who are absent will be given the assessment papers as practice
and the marks will not be included in the overall mark computation.</p>
<p>Only the following are considered as&nbsp;<strong>valid reasons for absences</strong>&nbsp;during
assessments:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>medical reasons supported by a medical certificate (MC) from a doctor.
MCs from Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) practitioners are not accepted
except if the TCM clinic is under the purview of a hospital.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Photo evidence of being COVID+ taken on day of assessment (e.g., ART+)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>bereavement of family members.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>any other reason deemed valid by the school.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A medical certificate or relevant evidence/documentation (e.g., copy of
the death certificate) must be given to the form teacher when the student
returns to school to support his/her absence.</p>
<p>All other reasons will be considered&nbsp;<strong>on a case-by-case basis subject to the schoolâ€™s approval.</strong>
</p>
<p>For students who are absent for an assessment&nbsp;<strong>without</strong>&nbsp;<strong>a valid reason</strong>,
a&nbsp;<strong>zero mark will be considered for that assessment</strong>&nbsp;and
this assessment mark will be considered in the computation of the subject
and overall total.</p>
<p><strong>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ASSESSMENT MAKE-UP</strong>
</p>
<p>All assessments will follow the stated day and time in the assessment
schedule. There is <strong>no assessment make-up</strong> for students who
are absent except for individual performance tasks <strong>(not including GEP assessment)</strong> that
span over a period and oral assessment, and the make-up will only be considered
for students with valid reason for absence. There is no make-up for group
performance tasks. If an assessment has make-up provisions, the school
will decide the date for the make-up.</p>
