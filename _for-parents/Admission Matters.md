<h3>Admission Matters</h3>
<h5>GETTING TO KNOW THE SCHOOL</h5>
<p>We appreciate your interest in Rosyth School. Regrettably, there are no
plans to organise an open house in 2024. We encourage you to explore the
wealth of information available on our website to gain a deeper understanding
of the unique educational experience we offer and our school history.</p>
<p>Should you have any specific queries or require further assistance, please
feel free to reach out to us directly.</p>

<h5>APPLICATION FOR PARENT VOLUNTEER (PV) PROGRAMME</h5>
<p></p>
<p>Rosyth School does not recruit parent volunteers to qualify for Phase
2B of the Primary 1 Registration Exercise, as we receive extensive support
from our Parent Support Group for school activities and programmes.</p>

<p><strong>Balloting</strong> will be conducted should the number of applications
exceed the number of vacancies in any phase. Singapore Citizen (SC) children
will be admitted first ahead of Permanent Resident children before home-school
distance is considered. Should the number of SC applications exceed the
number of vacancies in a specific phase, places will be balloted according
to the home-school distance category in the following order of priority:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Children living within 1km of the school of choice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Children living between 1km and 2km of the school of choice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Children living outside 2km of the school of choice</p>
</li>
</ul>

wish to seek admission to Primary One (P1) are required to undergo a two-step
process:</p>

the MOE P1 website in June, <strong>and</strong> 
<br><strong>Step 2:</strong> Non-SC / non-PR children who have submitted the
indication of interest form and are notified in October by MOE that they
