<h5>1. LEAVE OF ABSENCE</h5>
<p>The Leave of Absence (LOA) scheme was implemented in 1999 to enable students
accompanying their parents on overseas postings to maintain links with
Singapore and their schools through allowing them to retain their existing
school places. <strong>LOA fees</strong> are charged to defray the schools’
administrative costs of keeping in touch with these students. The LOA fee
of $156 is computed based on the miscellaneous fee:</p>
<p>Monthly Miscellaneous fee $13 = Standard fee $6.50 + 2nd tier $6.50
<br>Annual LOA Fee = $13 x 12 months = $156</p>
<p>LOA fee is non-refundable.</p>

<h5>4. SAFETY OF OUR CHILDREN</h5>
<p><strong><em>THINK SAFE, PLAY SAFE, STAY SAFE</em></strong>  <em>1. TRAFFIC ARRANGEMENTS</em> 
<br>a) Traffic arrangement for dropping off and picking up of students. i)
Below is a map (Diagram 1) of Rosyth School campus to guide your daily
commute to school.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/traffice_diagram.jpg">
</div>
<p>ii) Gates 1 and 7 are accessible to pedestrians only. We strongly urge
parents/ guardians and their children to use the designated pedestrian
crossings (marked with the letter A in Diagram 1 above) when walking to
school. For students who cycle to school, bicycle racks are available near
Gate 1. iii) Vehicles entering the school via Gate 2 during arrival and
dismissal can opt to take one of 2 routes depending on which drop off point
you are driving to. Students arriving by car must alight only at Drop-Off
Points 1 or 2 which are located outside the Indoor Sports Hall.</p>
<p>iv) For pick-up during dismissal, parents of P1 and P2 students, please
follow Route 1 as your children will be waiting for you at pick-up point
B1. Parents of P3 to P6 students, please follow Route 2 as your children
will be waiting for you at pick-up point B2. Families with 2 or more children
in the school will follow the arrangement of the youngest child. For dismissal,
please remind your child to be at the pick-up point early to facilitate
smooth traffic flow. No waiting is allowed at the pick-up points. Upon
arrival, please follow the instructions from our security personnel. While
driving inside the school compound, please be alert and adhere to the speed
limit of 15 km/h.</p>
<p>v) To ensure smooth traffic flow, we discourage parents from getting off
their cars to help their children with their bags, especially during arrival
and dismissal times. We seek parents’ support to prepare their children
to be ready to get off or into the car independently when the car stops
at the drop-off/ pick-up points.</p>
<p>vi) We advise all parents not to proceed beyond Gate 1 or Gate 7 if travelling
on foot when sending your child to school. All students should report directly
to the assembly venues punctually by 7.30a.m. for daily morning assembly.</p>
<p>vii) If you are picking up your child on foot, you will be allowed to
enter the school and wait at the parents’ waiting area near Gate 1 or you
can wait at the void deck outside Gate 7 after 1.20 p.m. Parents picking
your child up on foot via Gate 1 or Gate 7 should arrive to meet your child
only at the staggered dismissal timings provided in the table below and
not too early before. This is to avoid congestion at both areas. If you
need to wait for your older child after picking your younger child, please
do so without blocking the walkways.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/dismissal_timings.jpg">
</div>
<p>b) If you are driving to school from Ang Mo Kio Ave 3 (see Diagram 2 below)
and encounter problems keeping to the right lane at Serangoon North Ave
3, you should continue driving down the left lane and make a U-turn at
the next U-turn point. This will bring you back to the junction of Serangoon
North Ave 3 and Serangoon North Ave 4.** Please be considerate and refrain
from cutting queue and/or making unauthorised U-turns at any part of the
roads leading to the school.**</p>

</div>
<p>c) Dropping Off and Picking Up of Students Outside School. i. If you are
driving your child to school and wish to drop him/her off at Gates 1 or
7, please refrain from dropping your child off along Serangoon North Ave
4 as this will be dangerous for your child and add to the peak period traffic
congestion. ii. For your child’s safety as well as adherence to traffic
regulations as responsible motorists, please do not wait outside the school
gates or bus bays along Serangoon North Ave 4 to pick up your child.</p>
<p>d) School Gates Opening Hours:</p>

<p>e) Vehicle Access. Parents/guardians will be issued with vehicle entry
labels to facilitate easy identification by school security staff when
driving into school to drop-off and/or pick-up your child. Access to the
school compound outside of the stipulated timings will be strictly by prior
appointment with school staff and/or for official business. Such visits
will require registration at the guard post. To facilitate the issuance
of vehicle entry labels, parents/guardians will need to complete an online
request form via the PG. Families with 2 or more children in the school
will submit the request under the eldest child, indicating details of the
other children in the form. Each family will receive a physical vehicle
entry label. Please ensure that this label is prominently displayed during
your arrival into the school.</p>
<p>f) Entering School Premises. i) Visitors and parents entering the school
premises are permitted to access only the following parts of the school:</p>

post (Gates 1 and 2) before accessing school grounds. As registered visitors
will be provided with a security clearance sticker, the parent access passes
will no longer be issued/valid from 2024.</p>

<li>
<p>Use of HDB Car Parks. Should you use the HDB car parks near Gates 1 and
7, please help us to be good neighbours by not causing any inconvenience
or obstruction to the residents living there and by not honking vehicle
horns impatiently. Do not park in the no parking zones or the red lots
meant for season parking holders. Please slow down as you enter the car
park and give way to pedestrians.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Peak Period Traffic. The peak period traffic is between 6.55a.m. to 7.25a.m.
and 1.30p.m. to 2.00p.m. from Mondays to Fridays. This may be longer during

provided by the school personnel on duty. Do allow enough time to reach
the school before school starts at 7.30a.m.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Student Care Centre (SCC) Pick-up. For parents who are fetching their
child before 6.00p.m. do contact the SCC staff in advance to arrange for
pick-up at point B2 if you are driving or at the parents’ waiting area
via Gate 1 between 4:15pm to 6:00pm. You may also arrange to pick-up your
child from Gate 7 during this period. All parents are to refrain from leaving
your vehicle and/or walk to the SCC to meet your child. After 6.00pm, parents
will have to pick-up your child only from Gate 7.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fetching Students Early. Should you wish to pick up your child prior to
school dismissal (e.g., medical appointments, external examinations), kindly
inform your child’s form teacher in advance so that the staff can make
the necessary arrangements. Please also arrange with your child on the
timing to meet you at the GO. The GO staff will then assist with the early
dismissal for your child upon your arrival.</p>
</li>

<p><strong><em>1.6 HOAX CALLS</em></strong>

“Phone Kidnapping Scam” calls. If you should receive such a call about
your child during school hours, please contact us immediately to ascertain
the safety of your child. If the main office line is busy, kindly contact

<p><strong><em>1.7 INSURANCE</em></strong>

to provide basic coverage for our students in case of accidents. You may
refer to the NTUC Income <a href="https://www.income.com.sg/group-insurance-for-schools-and-moe-personnel/group-personal-accident-for-students" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">website</a> for
