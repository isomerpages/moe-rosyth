##### 1. LEAVE OF ABSENCE

The Leave of Absence (LOA) scheme was implemented in 1999 to enable students accompanying their parents on overseas postings to maintain links with Singapore and their schools through allowing them to retain their existing school places. **LOA fees** are charged to defray the schools’ administrative costs of keeping in touch with these students. The LOA fee of $156 is computed based on the miscellaneous fee: 

Monthly Miscellaneous fee $13 = Standard fee  $6.50 + 2nd tier $6.50 <br> 
Annual LOA Fee  = $13 x 12 months = $156   

LOA fee is non-refundable.
