##### 1. LEAVE OF ABSENCE

The Leave of Absence (LOA) scheme was implemented in 1999 to enable students accompanying their parents on overseas postings to maintain links with Singapore and their schools through allowing them to retain their existing school places. **LOA fees** are charged to defray the schools’ administrative costs of keeping in touch with these students. The LOA fee of $156 is computed based on the miscellaneous fee: 

Monthly Miscellaneous fee $13 = Standard fee  $6.50 + 2nd tier $6.50 <br> 
Annual LOA Fee  = $13 x 12 months = $156   

LOA fee is non-refundable.

**Procedures for Application for LOA**

First time applicant needs to do the following:        
      
* Inform your child's Form Teacher or the school’s Admin Manager by phone at 6481 2273 or email rosyth_sch@schools.gov.sg

##### 4. SAFETY OF OUR CHILDREN

***THINK SAFE, PLAY SAFE, STAY SAFE*** 

Safety of our children is the school’s top priority. We seek parents’ support as we work together to make the school’s environment a safe place for our children.  


*1. TRAFFIC ARRANGEMENTS* <br>

*1.1 Traffic flow outside school*  <br> 
a) Gate 2 is the ONLY entrance for vehicles into the school.  Gates 4 and 5 are only for vehicular exits.   During non-peak periods, vehicles can use Gate 5 which is fitted with an automated mechanised gate system to exit the school. Please approach the gate to activate the sensor.   

b) Gates 1 and 7 are accessible to pedestrians only.  Thus, students are required to use the pedestrian crossings (marked with the letter A) For the safety of your children, please do not attempt to enter or leave the school through Gates 4 or 5 on foot. Bicycle racks are available at the parents waiting area at Gate 1 should you be cycling to school.  

c) If you are driving along Serangoon North Ave 3 and encounter problem keeping to the right lane, you should *continue on the left lane along Serangoon North Ave 3 and make a ‘U’-turn*. This will bring you back to the junction of Serangoon North Ave 3 and Serangoon North Ave 4 again.

**DROPPING OFF AND PICKING UP OF STUDENTS**

*By Vehicle*

d) If you are driving your child to school and wish to drop him/her off at Gates 1 or 7, please refrain from dropping your child off along Serangoon North Ave 4 as this will both be dangerous for your child and obstruct traffic flow.   

e) Parents who are fetching their children will only be allowed to drive into the school after 1.45pm on Mon, Tue, Thu and Fri, and 12.45pm on Wed.  Please do not wait outside the school gates as this causes congestion along Serangoon North Ave 4 for other road users.

To ensure a smooth traffic flow, please do not park and wait for your child at the pickup points.

Parents of P1 to P2 students, please follow Route 1 as your children will be waiting for you at drop-off/ pick-up point B1.  Parents of P3 to P6 students, please follow Route 2 as your children will be waiting for you at drop-off/ pick-up point B2.  Families with 2 or more children in the school will have to follow the arrangement for the younger/ youngest child. **For arrival**, please follow the instructions from our security personnel.

***1.7 INSURANCE*** <br>
As part of our student well-being efforts, the school has purchased insurance to provide basic coverage for our students in case of accidents. You may refer to the NTUC Income  [website](https://www.income.com.sg/group-insurance-for-schools-and-moe-personnel/group-personal-accident-for-students) for the policy coverage and benefits. In the event of any claim, you have to do e-submission of your claim through their website. If you need higher coverage for your child, please arrange a separate policy from your preferred insurer.
