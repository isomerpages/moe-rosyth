<h5>1. LEAVE OF ABSENCE</h5>
<p>The Leave of Absence (LOA) scheme was implemented in 1999 to enable students
accompanying their parents on overseas postings to maintain links with
Singapore and their schools through allowing them to retain their existing
school places. <strong>LOA fees</strong> are charged to defray the schools’
administrative costs of keeping in touch with these students. The LOA fee
of $156 is computed based on the miscellaneous fee:</p>
<p>Monthly Miscellaneous fee $13 = Standard fee $6.50 + 2nd tier $6.50
<br>Annual LOA Fee = $13 x 12 months = $156</p>
<p>LOA fee is non-refundable.</p>
