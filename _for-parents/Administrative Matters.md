<h5>6. INSURANCE</h5>
<p>As part of our student well-being efforts, the school has purchased insurance
to provide basic coverage for our students in case of accidents. You may
refer to the NTUC Income <a href="https://www.income.com.sg/group-insurance-for-schools-and-moe-personnel/group-personal-accident-for-students" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">website</a> for
the policy coverage and benefits. In the event of any claim, you have to
do e-submission of your claim through their website. If you need higher
coverage for your child, please arrange a separate policy from your preferred
insurer.</p>
