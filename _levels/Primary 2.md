<h5>KEY PROGRAMMES FOR PRIMARY 2</h5>
<p><strong>P2 Learning Journey to Science Centre</strong>
</p>
<p>Primary 2 students are invited to embark on exciting learning journeys
to the Science Centre, where they can explore the wonders of nature through
the English STELLAR units, "Life in A Shell" or "A Butterfly is Born."</p>
<p>In the "Life in A Shell" experience, students will get up close to seashells,
garden snails, and hermit crabs, engaging in a sensory adventure that brings
these fascinating creatures to life. They'll learn about their unique traits
and create their very own snail craft, making the experience both educational
and fun.</p>
<p>In the "A Butterfly is Born" journey, students will step into the world
of insects, observing live butterflies and discovering their amazing life
cycles. To cap off the experience, they’ll take home a beautiful butterfly
life cycle craft, making their learning even more memorable.</p>
<p>These hands-on, interactive sessions connect classroom lessons with real-world
experiences, sparking curiosity and inspiring creativity in every child.
It’s a wonderful way for students to learn and explore the natural world
in an exciting and engaging way!</p>
