<h5>KEY PROGRAMMES FOR PRIMARY 6</h5>
<p><strong>Immersion Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>The Overseas Immersion Programme offers a transformative learning experience
for our Primary 6 Rosythians. Designed to broaden their cultural awareness
and nurture a global perspective, it aligns with the 21st Century Competencies
of Critical Thinking, Creativity, Collaboration, and Communication. Additionally,
this programme provides students with greater exposure to Asia, particularly
ASEAN countries, deepening their understanding of Singapore’s role in the
world while fostering a strong sense of belonging and commitment to the
nation.</p>

<p><strong>Care Carnival</strong>
</p>
<p>The Care Carnival is a unique social innovation project led by our Primary
6 students, integrating their innovation learning with Values-in-Action—a
Key Student Development Experience. As students prepare for the Care Carnival,
they cultivate empathy, social responsibility, and strengthen their I-CARE
values.</p>
<p>Through collaboration, they apply skills such as designing publicity posters,
crafting handmade items, and conceptualizing their stalls. With an entrepreneurial
mindset, students take full ownership of their stalls, guided by their
teachers, and inspire their peers to contribute to the community. The event
features exciting game booths, creative craft stations, and thrift stalls,
making it a memorable and meaningful experience for all.</p>

<p><strong>P6 Graduation Day</strong>
</p>
<p>The P6 Graduation Day is a significant milestone for students as they
celebrate their final days at Rosyth School. During the Awards Ceremony
segment, I-CARE champions, outstanding academic prize winners, student
councillors and CCA leaders are recognised for their achievements and contributions.</p>
<p>The concert segment provides students with an opportunity to showcase
what they have learned from their post-examination activities. It also
serves as a heartfelt platform for them to express their appreciation to
school leaders, teachers, parents, and friends, making the occasion both
meaningful and memorable.</p>
