<h5>KEY PROGRAMMES FOR PRIMARY 3</h5>
<p><strong>P3 Learning Journey to Geylang Serai Heritage Gallery</strong>
</p>
<p>History came alive for our Primary 3 students during the learning Journey
to Geylang Serai Heritage Gallery. Students delved into the history of
Geylang Serai and played the role of explorers to understand its importance
to the Malay and Muslim communities in Singapore. Students got to hear
stories and view artifacts at the gallery. Also, the students took a precinct
walk to the Geylang Serai market, where they observed the bustling atmosphere
of Malay, Indian, and Chinese food stalls, along with the diverse display
of Malay traditional clothing and aromatic spice stalls. The students gained
insights into the history of Geylang Serai and its pivotal role in the
Malay and Muslim communities, making the learning journey an enriching
experience.</p>
