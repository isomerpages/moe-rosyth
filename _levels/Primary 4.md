<h5>KEY PROGRAMMES FOR PRIMARY 4</h5>
<p><strong>I-DARE Outdoor and Science Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>At Rosyth, we aim to nurture our Rosythians holistically, focusing on
both values and character development. The I-DARE Teambuilding Day provides
Rosythians the chance to build positive peer relationships and foster teamwork
with their classmates. Through engaging in challenging outdoor activities,
students not only enhance their resilience but also gain hands-on experience
in outdoor learning environments. Rosythians also learn to appreciate and
care for the environment as they explore the biodiversity of plants and
animals. Additionally, students will collaborate in activities that integrate
STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) concepts in a
real-world outdoor context.</p>

<p><strong>P4 Cohort LJ to Kreta Ayer Heritage Gallery</strong>
</p>
<p>Our Primary 4 students explore the Kreta Ayer Heritage Gallery, immersing
themselves in the vibrant cultural legacy of Singapore’s Chinese community.
Through interactive activities, they engage with traditional art forms
such as Chinese opera, puppetry, calligraphy, nanyin music, and tea appreciation.
A precinct walk around Chinatown enhances their experience as they uncover
stories of iconic landmarks and trades that shaped Kreta Ayer’s history.
This journey provides students with valuable insights into the contributions
of the Chinese community and fosters a deeper appreciation for Singapore’s
multicultural identity.</p>

<p><strong>Primary 4 Museum-Based Learning</strong>
</p>
<p>The Museum-based Learning (MBL) experience is designed to provide the
breadth and depth of learning local art as part of all Primary 4 students’
core learning experience in the art curriculum. The experience comprises
pre-, during- and post-visit experiences to one of the local art museums
where students are involved as artists and audience to create and appreciate
art. MBL culminates in a showcase of students’ art expression that will
form part of the collective memory for all students.</p>
