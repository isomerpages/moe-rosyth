<h5>KEY PROGRAMMES FOR PRIMARY 5</h5>
<p><strong>Outdoor Learning Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>The Outdoor Learning Programme (OLP) stands as a pivotal milestone in
every Primary 5 student's educational journey. Through immersive and challenging
outdoor activities, students develop essential life skills that extend
beyond the classroom. The programme cultivates resilience as students push
beyond their comfort zones, fostering valuable teamwork and collaborative
skills as they support one another through various challenges. This transformative
experience not only strengthens individual character but also builds lasting
bonds amongst classmates, preparing them for future challenges.</p>
